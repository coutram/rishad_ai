Five interlocking forces are sculpting the future of work:\r\rGenerational Shifts: For the first time four and possibly five generations will work in the same firms. The youngest employees in their 20�s are Gen-Z which are about to become the largest component of the work force. The eldest employees are Baby Boomers who are turning 60 and have dominated the workplace in numbers, income, and impact. In between are Millennials and Gen-X. The mindsets, expectations, worldviews of each of these groups are significantly different. In addition to the rise of Gen-Z we also are seeing a rapid aging of the workforce and a declining population. Technology: We are entering an AI infused age where the cost of knowledge may soon be zero. More than half of the workforce in most countries are knowledge workers",

How many will be lost and what new careers will be forged. Marketplaces: Today hundreds of marketplaces such as Upwork allow talent to be procured from anywhere, Etsy and Shopify allow individuals to access customers from everywhere, App stores and Cloud services from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Open AI allow small and medium firms to access billion-dollar tech. New Ways of working: Technology, demographics and marketplaces are now turbocharging and enabling scaling of different ways of working giving rise to a world of side-hustles and side-gigs. The Long Term Impact of Covid:  Covid is just one of five factors creating seismic change at work and it�s biggest impact may not be on where people work but the emotional rewiring that took place during the nearly three years of Covid where people re-considered the role of work in their lives. For these reasons a few years from now work may be as different today from 2019 as 2019 was in the age before low cost  telecommunication, computers, mobile phones and the Internet. We have a choice. We can either be reactive and struggle to adjust to transformational events on the fly, or we can be proactive and control the narrative�reinventing work to align with the evolving environment. As a futurist who has had a highly successful career because I�ve anticipated and capitalized on emerging trends, I advocate the latter. Unfortunately, many organizations are still mired in traditional practices and structures. They attempt to preserve the status quo, tweaking it in order to keep up with changes but retaining the foundational elements of work�the boss-employee relationship, the supervised, centralized structure, the emphasis on financial motivation, the one-size-fits-all work environment, the culture of loyalty, seniority and consensus. It�s a bad strategy, especially after two-plus years of COVID and its impact on how we work",

Consider a few statistics:\r\rBy 2027, 86. 5 million people or half the workforce will be freelancers. In  2022, over one-third of U. S. workers and two-thirds of those under 30 juggle different �gigs� (rather than work full-time at one job). The �fractionalized� employee (my term) is becoming a reality. According to research conducted by the McKinsey consulting firm, 80% of people who worked at home during COVID liked it and 41% asserted they were more productive than they were working from the office. 59% of respondents (in a study conducted by Owl Labs) said they would be more likely to choose an employer that offered remote work compared to those that didn�t. But the need to rethink work goes beyond even these statistics about remote work and the shift from full-time to part-time and gig jobs. For instance, people used to work primarily for income and achievement. While these factors are still important, we�re seeing a growing number of people choosing jobs based on meaning (the work is fulfilling, satisfying them on a deeper level), community (connection with like-minded people) and social purpose. Millennials and Gen Zers, especially, are searching for work experiences that fit their personal beliefs and styles�they want the freedom to work where, when and how they want. A true holacracy (a boss-less office) may never become a widespread reality, but we�re going to see a trend toward less supervision and more independence�a trend that will have an enormous impact on everything from hiring to culture to performance reviews. To rethink work can be a scary thought, especially for those with a vested interest in the current system. But it�s also an absolutely necessary thought. Schools, banks, law firms, startups, medical offices�every sector will be affected by the current or soon-to-be-emerging trends and events that I�ll describe",

This book will enlighten and empower its readers to thrive in a world  where the who, what,  why, where, when and how  of work will transform\r\rWho will people work for change. Until recently, most people worked for someone else for a relatively long period of time�a large corporation, the government, an educational institution and so on. But communication technology advances, new business models and marketplaces and changing generational mindsets are transferring power to the individual. This transfer gives people work options, and they�re exercising them in all sorts of way. For instance, a growing number of individuals are choosing to work for themselves. Zoom, Slack and other platforms facilitate work processes; Esty, Shopify and Substack help users leverage their capabilities and scale themselves and their ideas to growing markets. Others are opting for greater control over who they work for. Digital natives have lived through 9/11, the Great Recession and COVID, and their attitudes have changed�they believe much more in themselves than in organizations. As a result, people are rejecting the old model of working for one organization for a decade or longer. Instead, they�re choosing to be gig workers, to create startups, to become fractionalized employees, to dedicate themselves to and work for a cause. To mix and match employers. Just as employees have numerous options, so too do organizations. This book will help leaders capture talent by structuring jobs in ways that appeal to this new work sensibility. What will organizations look like. Like nothing in the past",

In the past, organizational models were like classical music, with a conductor, orchestra and well-rehearsed score. In the future, they will be like improvisational jazz, involving different players who take the music in surprising, unpredictable directions. Companies will be fluid, forming and re-forming themselves to fit the market and emerging needs. They�ll mix full-time and part-time workers, in-office and remote employees, teams and individual performers; they�ll shift alliances continuously, collaborating with a range of suppliers, consultants and others as need dictates. Why will people work. People have always worked for a variety of reasons�income, identity, community, social purpose and personal meaning. As noted earlier, COVID and shifting social norms are causing more people to choose jobs and careers based on factors other than income. Empowering technologies, too, make it easier for people to pursue meaningful work. But another trend is taking place that has a profound effect on Why. In the past, one full-time job rarely satisfied all our reasons for working. The law firm partner was well paid but found little personal satisfaction in his job. Or the social worker found satisfaction in helping others but she was micromanaged, hampering her personal workstyle. Today, however, we�re seeing a shift to people satisfying all or most of their Whys by having more than one job�two thirds of those under 30 are combining different gigs. A mix of jobs�side hustles, volunteer positions and so on�is much better able to satisfy all our work requirements than a single job. Where will people work. In the metaverse. At home. In morphing offices that will bear little resemblance to traditional places of business. In planes. And perhaps in the not-so-distant-future, in self-driving cars.

COVID certainly has powered this trend, but so too has our entering the Third Age of the Internet--AI, 5G, the Metaverse, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and other developments are reshaping industries and companies. U. S. companies have formed alliances with organizations in India, China, Brazil, Russia, Vietnam and elsewhere�people work virtually and sometimes physically far from home, and they will do even more of this in the future. It�s not just that people are working remotely. It�s that they are working on teams with members from seven different countries, that their customers and suppliers are located on different continents. In the future, being a global company isn�t just a description of office locations but of a mindset�we are becoming workers of the world. To answer this �where� question, I�ll offer advice about how to maximize flexible workspaces, creating policies and cultures that cater to locational agility. When will people work. Whenever. The 9-to-5 day has long since passed. Until recently, work was confined to certain days and hours because of rigid structures�we all needed to work together in the same place for efficiency, for people to be managed properly. Now, we require temporal flexibility for many reasons. Most obviously, if we�re doing business with people on the other side of the world, the time zones are different. Less obviously, efficiency is less important than innovation, disruption and agility. These qualities are less likely to emerge if we confine our work to rigid schedules. Great ideas surface in the middle of the night, when we�re exercising, when we become inspired by a piece of music at the symphony. We need to feel empowered to call, text or email our colleagues to obtain their feedback and ideas at this moment of inspiration. This doesn�t mean that we become 24/7 workaholics",

How will leadership change. We are witnessing the decline of the manager and the rise of a new type of leader. In the past, the managerial role was essential to efficient organizational operation�they managed by walking around and checking in and on their people. In an increasingly distributed world where people often work virtually, you can�t manage by walking around. Younger generations, especially, hate being monitored. While employees used to rely on managers for news and expertise, they can now use YouTube, Khan Academy, Coursera and other online tools to learn what they need to know. Managers, therefore, are becoming anachronisms, while a new type of leader is becoming crucial for organizational success. This type of leader displays three traits: a growth mindset (growing people and businesses, macro-imagining possibilities rather than micro-managing employees); improvisation skills (the agility to pivot on a dime); and a thirst for learning (in a world of rapid change, continuous learning is the only way to survive). This book is divided into three sections. The first section examines why we need to rethink work�the factors that are causing traditional structures and styles to be ineffective. The second section section around the ways in which work needs to be rethought. The third section will address what we can do about it�the steps that organizations can take to change themselves so they�ll be prepared for the Great Rethinking.

SECTION I: THE FORCES DRIVING THE GREAT RETHINKING\r\rChapter 1�SEISMIC SOCIETAL SHIFTS\r\r\tWe tend to think of workplace changes in terms of technology. How various platforms may turn physical office spaces into anachronisms. How algorithms may replace human decision-making. Societal shifts can affect work just as profoundly. Consider five trends:\r\r\t�The rise of the individual\r      �Aging and shrinking populations\r�Multiple generations with different life experiences and mindsets in the same workplace \r�The freelance revolution\r�Disengagement\r\r\tThese changes are already altering our perspective on everything from hiring to compensation to leadership. In some instances, the impact is obvious: We create open workspaces that helps attract young talent. Many times, though, we�re unaware of all the ramifications. How are these societal shifts affecting our teams, our hiring practices, our retention policies. How might they play out in the future. We need to be aware of these issues. And we need to know what to do about them. To that end, let�s begin with how COVID has shifted the balance of power away from the organization and toward the individual. THE RISE OF THE INDIVIDUAL\r\r\tChanges that were underway though largely unseen for years became visible and impactful during COVID. The virus affected the way people worked and caused them to question how they would work, why they would work, who they would work for, where they would work and what work meant to them. This changed consciousness has empowered individuals and disempowered organizations. Consider:\r\t\r      People can work productively away from the office. The traditional notion of a boss is an anachronism. Some people work best late at night, early in the morning or on weekends",

The entire workforce now understands that companies could allow individuals to work in a spectrum of ways without losing competitiveness or productivity. It is like we all woke from a dream and saw the light. There is no unseeing. Nonetheless, some managers wish to go back to the way work was pre-COVID, leading to a rift between these traditionalists and the rethinkers. The rethinking argument is particularly strong when you view it based on how individuals have been empowered by recent technological, demographic and cultural shifts. Specifically, individuals now have: \r\rBecome more informed due to a plethora of new platforms (e. g. , Glass Door or Reddit) that have decreased the organizational ability to keep information secret or hard to get. Had their minds expanded by working in different ways over the past three years, and like champagne corks, they have swelled and no longer can fit back into containers of the past. Discovered new tools and platforms that allow them to find work globally and deliver solutions using top notch technology at accessible cost, reducing the need to work for companies. Taken charge of their careers and are much less willing to trust their future to corporations and managers after the Great Recession and COVID. They now want to control their own destinies. They are less interested in working for others and more interested in working for themselves. This is very much a mindset shift. People think about their jobs and careers differently than in the past. Too often, the upholders of the status quo castigate this mindset, but many times, it�s because they misunderstand it. To foster a better understanding of what an individual-centric mindset translates to, here are four principles that shape it:\r\r      People are not leaving work but leaving work as it is done today",

AGING AND SHRINKING POPULATIONS\r\tAs of this writing, many companies are struggling to fill positions. Based on the data, this situation is only going to get worse. It�s a matter of supply and demand, and the supply is dwindling. The population in most of the world outside Africa and to some extent, India, has started to decline. The year 2021 is the first time since 1937 that the U. S. population grew by fewer than one million people, featuring the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began annual population estimates. Just as significant, the population is aging. Many nations will have 25% or more of their citizens over the age of 65, and recent UN projections indicate that 1 out of every 60 people will be over the age of 65 in 2050:\r\r \r\t\r\r\tThe organizational reflex is to focus on the NEXT BIG THING, on the NEW AND EMERGING and especially on the YOUNG.

The fight against sexism and racism may well extend to ageism, producing compelling reasons for organizations to increase the number of older workers they hire. Perhaps more importantly, the flexible work schedules and technological tools popularized during COVID are tailor-made for seasoned workers. In the past, they might have retired. Today and especially in the coming years, they can be crucial members of organizations, providing insights based on hard-won experiences. Consider, too, that even organizations skeptical of seasoned workers may be forced to hire them out of necessity. The workforce is shrinking. Retirement-age people are working longer out of financial necessity. Anti-immigration sentiments are restricting the flow of people to Western countries. Hiring older employees may be the only way to fill certain positions. Given this environment, here are three issues that every organization should contemplate:\r\r\t�Polarizing divisions\r\t\r      Will the tensions between Seasoned employees and younger generations be exacerbated by the former group staying on the job longer than the latter groups think they should. Will the disparate wealth/salaries of the groups be another driver of polarization.

This might mean introducing and adapting workplace products and designing services with seasoned employees in mind�standing desks for people with bad backs, small offices for people who work better with a degree of privacy. �Career planning for older as well as younger employees. These days, careers last a long time�five decades in some cases. Someone who is 55 or 60 may not be looking for a promotion but a graceful exit strategy over the next five years. Another individual may want one last hurrah (a position of responsibility and impact) before exiting. Companies that provide seasoned employees with coaching and options are more likely to attract and keep them. There�s also the issue of acculturating seasoned employees to new realities so they can flourish. As firms increasingly leverage distributed and unbundled work to find new ways to architect teams, most people are going to work across generations and not just across time zones. What emotional and intellectual skills and what expertise and craft will they need to flourish and how will they re-invent themselves in an increasingly plug and play world. GENERATION GAPS\r\r\tMost companies have employees that span four generations:\r* Baby Boomer�(57 to 75 years old). * Generation X (41 to 56 years old). * Millennial�(26 to 40 years old). * Generation Z (25 years old and younger).

The younger generations� upbringing in a world of digital media was not only fragmented but gave them voice. Graduating from college with significant debt and dealing with difficult economic times, they have less trust in government and organizations than previous generations; they also question capitalism and are often strong supporters of unions. Less positive about the future than Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, they strive for more than work/life balance; they want to work for companies aligned with their purpose and values and not just for a paycheck. Diverse and open to fluid identities and concerned about climate change, their perspectives on social and environmental issues are often different from their parents\r\tThose parents, many of whom are baby boomers, grew up in a capitalist economy that lifted all boats and made life better. For them, work represented the external validations of money and power�purpose and meaning were often not a significant concern. During their careers, women often didn�t have positions of power and Caucasians dominated leadership positions. All these generational traits have produced the opposite work effect of what one might expect based solely on age: older generations are wanting or needing to work past traditional retirement ages because of declining safety nets and pensions or for reasons of identity and community; younger generations are quitting quietly or noisily because traditional workplaces are antithetical to their beliefs and preferences.

Millennials judge their achievements based on the balance between work and family, money and personal growth and external validation leavened with internal satisfaction. �World View. Baby boomers often possess a parochial perspective, more comfortable in homogeneous groups in familiar surroundings. Millennials grew up in a more diverse cultural milieu and a low-cost travel environment, producing a broader perspective that it not only more global but more empathetic toward those who are different from them in terms of gender, race and religion. Gen Zers are more extreme versions of Millennials, being more anxious, digitally savvy, driven to speak up about purpose and to question working for a given organization. Both these younger generational groups are the future, and they�re going to be driving a lot of organizational change. Some older organizational leaders may not like their attitudes and behaviors, but they ignore them at their peril. They may especially dislike their propensity to change jobs.

It�s even more instructive, though, to consider what�s motivating people to freelance. A�May 2021 survey�of 1,000 U. S. adults showed that 39% would consider quitting if their employers weren�t flexible about remote work. Among Millennials and Gen Zs, that figure was 49%. Clearly, they�re searching for workplaces where people are granted more freedom and independence than is traditionally allowed. They�ve seen what has happened to the parents and even their grandparents who adhered to restrictive rules and conditions, only to be fired when economic conditions worsened. They don�t want to rent themselves to corporations. They believe that management doesn�t have their best interests at heart. They want the freedom to work when and how they want. They also want the satisfaction and equity that comes with doing their own thing. Organizations are fooling themselves if they believe that tweaks to policies�i. e. providing the option of working from home one day a week�it sufficient to satisfy most employees� need for greater independence. This is especially true for Gen Z employees, though with the taste of independence that COVID provided, it�s an attitudinal shift that affects all generations to some extent. Sam Parker, a British journalist and content strategist, wrote about this issue in The Guardian, noting that given Gen Z�s experiences (housing crisis, personal debt, etc. ), we should �realise how ridiculous it is to expect them to tackle the challenges we left behind by working tirelessly and without complaint for one corporation or another, hoping it�ll all be OK. They�re far too shrewd, too determined, too hopeful for that. �\rBROKEN ENGAGEMENTS\r\r\tPeople work harder, smarter and more innovatively when they care about what they do",

Every year there is a new theme from �Quiet Quitting� to �Lying Flat Generation� but regardless of what it is called the phenomenon is less about laziness and ennui and more about disengagement at work, as well as a desire to escape the stress of heavy workloads and managers who are still running their groups in a pre-COVID manner. Disengagement has a number of causes, and an ADP (Automatic Data Processing) study identifies stress as a primary one. Nearly seven in 10 workers surveyed said they experience stress at work at least weekly, up from 62% pre-pandemic, according to ADP. One in seven said they feel stressed at work every day. Key stressors include the length of the workday and concerns over job security. �\r      A Gallup study found that workers who reported declines in engagement cited a lack of clarity about expectations from managers, not feeling connected to a company�s mission or purpose, little to no recognition for hard work, and receiving scant career development as key reasons for their disengagement. The Gallup study found that disengagement was a particular problem among Gen Z and younger Millennials, as the following data indicates:\r* The percentage of engaged employees under the age of 35 dropped by six percentage points from 2019 to 2022. And during the same time, the percentage of actively disengaged employees increased by six points. * Younger workers have dropped 10 or more points in the percentage who strongly agree that someone cares about them, someone encourages their development, and they have opportunities to learn and grow. * Fully remote and hybrid young workers dropped 12 points in strong agreement that someone encourages their development. * Disturbingly, less than four in 10 young remote or hybrid employees clearly know what is expected of them at work.

Just as alarming, their attitude may eventually cause their companies to quit on them. A lack of engagement is not just an American phenomenon. In China, the route to success used to be hard work, marriage and children. Many people there viewed the country�s authoritarianism as a fair trade-off for being lifted out of poverty. But with employees working longer hours and housing prices rising faster than incomes, young Chinese especially fear that they will be the first generation that doesn�t do better than the previous generation. These young Chinese even have a name: the �Lie-Flat� generation. To lie flat means to forego marriage, not have children, stay unemployed and eschew material wants such as a house or a car. Leon Ding, for instance, is a 22-year-old who has been lying flat for three months and thinks of his act as �silent resistance�; he dropped out of his last year of university because he didn�t like the computer science major his parents had chosen for him. The epidemic of disengagement, then, seems to be spreading globally, at least among younger workers. To counteract the spread and treat this condition, organizations need to help their people find meaningful work. RESPONDING TO SOCIETAL SHIFTS\r\tThe various societal shifts described here aren�t going away. That�s why organizations need to re-imagine their workplaces to remain agile and productive. Here are three suggestions for that re-imagining:\r\r      �Enhance Flexibility.

Finally, to retain older workers and to attract younger workers, companies will need to offer the option of becoming a fractionalized employee�somewhat who works part-time. �Focus on diversity. This isn�t diversity for diversity�s sake but for competitive advantage. To attract and keep younger workers, consider generational issues: \r\rGen Z and Millennials expect diversity in the work force. Gen Z and Millennials are far more diverse than Baby Boomers and Gen X due to a combination of more women in the workplace and the growth of immigration. Diverse workplaces are likely to be more innovative and resonate with their customer bases. �Be Sensitive to Purpose and Sustainability. The two younger generations both as potential employees and purchasers care deeply about a company�s policy on sustainability, diversity, and equity. If there is one word that should drive the workplace structures, policies, programs, and cultures of tomorrow, it is: OPEN. More specifically, here are six ways they should strive to be open:\r\r1. Open to different ways of working: Not just the flexibility to work from a distance or in the office but providing people with several different ways to be categorized from part time to full time work each with its own trade-offs. 2. Open to different lifestyles and viewpoints: Being receptive to diversity in talent and diversity in opinion. 3.

Chapter 2�COMMUTING TO THE MULTIVERSE\r\r\tIt shouldn�t surprise anyone that technological advances are changing the nature of work. What might surprise a lot of people, however, are the range of these changes. Even more surprising: the emerging and future impact of tech on how, where and when we work. People tend to focus on the way in which technology enables employees to work remotely, and as significant as that shift is, it just scratches the surface of the ongoing metamorphosis. Consider that as little as five or ten years ago, the title of this chapter might have seemed like science fiction. We have come so far so fast that it�s difficult to keep up with all the technological innovations and how they�re affecting the workplace. To stay current, we need to understand the tech evolution as it relates to work�the subject of this chapter. Let�s start by looking at a company that has changed in response to and in anticipation of technological advances. OPERATING LIVE, SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS\r\r\tHaving worked for many years at Publicis Groupe, I can tell you that the company I joined many years ago bears little resemblance to the one that exists today. While the impetus for the changes are varied, technology has driven many of them. This is especially true when it comes to the three different ways employees now �gather�:\r\r\t�Live. To counteract the effects of remote work-facilitating technologies, companies like Publicis have come up with ways to bring their people together.

For this reason, it�s valuable to look at technological evolution in an historical context, seeing how we got from Point A to Point B and looking ahead toward Point C. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND WORK\r\r\r\r      The advent of steam engines and railroads, electricity, and the modern assembly line were the three key advances that redefined work as we moved from the Agricultural Age to the Industrial Age. The modern factory and office and theories of management were optimized for a world defined by centralized work locations near these huge engines of mass production that in turn were clustered around raw material or easily accessed means of transport. People and opportunities moved from rural locations, agricultural jobs and craft-based industries to cities, industrial jobs built around mass production. In the �80s with the advent and expansion of personal computers, the 1990s creation of the World Wide Web and the 2000s rise of mobile phones thrust us into the Information Age by 2010. Over 80 percent of all jobs are now in the Service sector. Even as jobs moved from manufacturing to services beginning in the �70s and accounted for four out of five jobs in the 2000s the centralized and clustered model of work built for the manufacturing aged dominated. This ended March 2020, when the entire world began a three-year experiment with alternative modes of working. The results from the experiment proved that most companies had been working with an outmoded model of work. Technology had eliminated many of the reasons that people needed to cluster together in centralized places for a large portion of their work lives. In this new paradigm, productivity did not decline but increased. The cost of doing business declined as companies could hire from anywhere and eliminate many costs of housing and moving people",

Broadband penetration, powerful and cheap mobile and computing devices, and cloud computing have ushered in a new world of work. Business to business and business to consumer software removed not only the friction of distance but the friction of mechanical movement of work. We have arrived at the dawn of the Third Connected Age of Technology. The First Connected Age began in 1993, featuring computers, rudimentary online service and the advent of the World Wide Web. Search and e-Commerce began in this Age, as did Amazon and eBay. In 2007 we entered the Second Connected Age, turbocharging the workplace not just because broadband speeds increased, and costs were lowered but because of smart phones and social media we were now truly mobile connected to almost everybody from everywhere all the time. The Cloud came into being and millions of new businesses were born because of the ability to advertise on search and social and ship using ecommerce while accessing world class technology over the cloud. Every business invested heavily in technology and reinvented its processes and workflow. Companies like Dropbox and Zoom flourished, connecting people and workflow quickly and inexpensively. Because of Covid, every company was re-wired around connected workers working with connected workflow. In two years, decades of computing technology produced a quantum jump of how work was done.

As new technology collapses distance and time, it also increases the speed of business. We need to acclimate to working faster. The steam engine, telegraph, telephone, airplane, fax, email, and the Internet all reduced the time it took to span distances, making the world smaller and the pace of business both faster and continuous. When one part of the world is asleep, work is handed off and continues seamlessly in another part of the world.

LEARN FROM THE PAST ABOUT THE FUTURE\r\r      For nearly three decades my career has been deeply intertwined with technology, allowing me to observe its changes at Publicis Groupe and its clients. Over the past five years, my advisory and board member roles have also provided this perspective. The communications business has always changed as technology shifted. The business was first a print-based business and then a print and broadcast business with radio initially and then television dominating it. In the early �90s with the advent of the internet, a team of us began some of the first digital marketing and digital media companies and the past two decades the entire business of marketing, media and communications has restructured itself around the internet. Wave after wave of technology from search to e-commerce to social to mobile to now AI and Web 3 have shifted every aspect of all business. Having observed all this first hand, I�ve come to three conclusions that apply to all organizations experiencing this technological evolution:\r\r1)Technology does not care for anybody�s business model or way of working.

But what technology really enabled was not just better ways to communicate but new ways of doing business, giving rise to a range of competitors. For instance, social media leveraged YouTube video�s cost effectiveness and ease of distribution. The advent of E-commerce made it possible to sell without Walmart or Walgreens, and companies like Harrys and Dollar Shave Club were born and ate deeply into Gillette market share despite Gillette having a superior product, brand, distribution, and spending. The new media allowed for direct distribution, subscription services, word of mouth and sampling, and customers recognized that the new blades were good enough but much cheaper and much more convenient",

Remind yourself that the typewriter did not write �A Farewell to Arms� but Hemingway did. If I had a word processer and ChatGPT and Hemingway has a pen, he would write better. Of course, if Hemingway also had ChatGPT, he would be that much better than me. Hemingway with a Substack would have scaled amazingly better than most. As talented individuals do with TikTok. Today streaming and the Internet makes one of the most popular courses at Harvard on�Justice�or�Happiness�at Yale available to everybody for free. It�s not the technology that makes these courses great, but the talent of professors Laurie Santos and Michael Sandel. FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE\r\tLet me conclude this chapter by returning to my earlier theme of striking a balance between working digitally and interacting personally. The remote-versus-in-person debate continues to rage, and given the amazing technological tools that emerged, it�s tempting to concede: �Okay, as much as we might miss the fun and energy of people being in the same room, that�s the old paradigm, and it�s time to move on the new, more efficient paradigm that technology has made possible. �   \r\tThis concession is a mistake. We know that in-person interactions produce three crucial benefits:�learning, relationship building and problem solving/creative idea generation. Learning: Some types of learning take place by watching others in action or being mentored by bosses in an apprentice/guild like model. This is probably true for many industries and particularly for people early in their career or new to a company. Relationship/Network Building: While relationships can be built online (for example dating apps), in-person meetings can help deepen and strengthen relationships",

Whether it be the unexpected interaction between two colleagues or the in person back and forth of a brainstorming, these are benefits that result from being together\r\tAt the same time, it�s also a mistake to go too far in the other direction�to subordinate digital options and opportunities to in-person interactions. This is especially true as of this writing since many companies are implementing return-to-office policies. According to a recent Slack study, �work-related stress and anxiety has hit the highest levels since our surveying began in the summer of 2020:\r* More than a third of knowledge workers (34%) have reverted to working from the office five days a week, the greatest share since Future Forum began surveying in June 2020. * With this shift, scores have dropped to near-record lows across all eight employee experience measures that we survey. Work-related stress and anxiety is at its worst since our surveying began, dropping 28% compared with last quarter, while work-life balance dropped 17% quarter over quarter. �\r\r      Given these problems, businesses would be wise to take a cue from a company like L�Or�al, which even before COVID recognized that they needed to find a way maximize technology�s benefits while also offsetting its drawbacks. As a result of this recognition, L�Or�al made a series of changes in offices from Copenhagen to Paris. In November 2017, L�Or�al opened new offices at Levallois-Perret on the outskirts of Paris. Named �Seine 62�, the campus is the latest in a series to have been opened in the Paris region, Copenhagen and Manhattan",

In addition, L�Or�al�s Nordics tower in Copenhagen has been specifically designed to enable employees to arrange their own personal timetable. An individual space with a view over the Copenhagen canal is provided for people who want to work alone and to find inspiration, while other areas have been created for group projects.

Sellers have continuously changed how, where, what and when they sell. They�ve made it easier to buy with credit cards. They�ve bypassed retailers with direct-to-consumer methods. They�ve made it possible to purchases at kiosks, pop-ups and other variations of the retail norm. They�ve decreased the time from purchase to delivery. They�ve offered a greater variety of goods and services. They�ve cut customer costs. These changes accelerated with the introduction of the Internet and emergence of new technologies, some of which we discussed in the previous chapter. Already these changes have enabled smaller companies to thrive and compete in an eco-system provided by larger companies. The marketplaces allow both whales and plankton to co-exist feeding of and thriving with each other. Now and in the coming years, however, marketplace innovation isn�t just accelerating but taking quantum leaps. The changes that are taking place will change the world of work in ways both obvious and nuanced. We need to understand these new and emerging marketplaces and how they will affect everything from careers to the competitive landscape. MARKETPLACE TYPES\r\r\tTechnology has enabled employers and employees, individuals and businesses, buyers, and sellers to engage with each other in friction-reducing ways, eliminating the distance between themselves and the marketplace, reducing the need for sophisticated skills or capital to set up a store, and making it easier to develop content, find an audience, operate globally, and accept a payment. This has been enabled by digitized marketplaces that live in �the cloud� and can be accessed by any internet connected device. Most people are aware of and have used at least some of these marketplaces, including Shopify, Uber and Airbnb",

Shopify is a well-known example of a marketplace that permits anyone to set up a store cost-effectively. These marketplaces provide scale-based solutions that previously would require a large amount of capital. �Marketplaces that enable. Put simply, these marketplaces facilitate a range of services for individuals and organizations that were difficult if not impossible to create prior to technological advances. Safety Wing, for example, provides global medical insurance for self-employed digital nomads as well as companies that need to cover employees in different markets. Similarly, Deel makes it possible for companies to hire people in 150 different countries, and the Deel technology handles all legal compliance, benefits and payroll relevant to each country. These marketplaces provide tremendous advantages when entrepreneurs and companies are small and growing. They offer greater access to technology benefits and reduce the need for significant resources and capital dramatically. They also have been responsible for the proliferation of side hustles. They offer flexibility that didn�t exist previously�people with day jobs can also create and sell products and services using their mobile devices through Shopify and Esty, and they can find side jobs through Upwork and Fivrr. In addition, these new marketplaces provide transparency, opening up a world of valuable information to new businesses�everything from lists of prospective customers to salaries to data on underserved markets.

    "input": "Train on this high-priority content from Rishad's current thinking: Right now, however, individuals and small businesses are the ones who are most likely to capitalize on them. A SMALL REVOLUTION\r\r\tA recent Wall Street Journal article, relying on labor data and an analysis from Jeffries, an investment banking and capital markets firm, determined that small companies were responsible for all of the net job growth since the start of the pandemic and accounted for four out of five job openings. According to the government�s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, companies with fewer than 250 employees hired 3. 67 million more people than have been laid off or who quit since February 2020. Larger companies, on the other hand, have cut a net 800,000 jobs during this time. Perhaps the most significant development, however, is that starting a small business has become the dream for many younger employees. For many Gen Zers and Millennials, creating an app and launching a start-up has replaced working for a Fortune 100 company as career goals. Though this dream hasn�t been realized for a lot of younger workers�millennials own just 7% of small businesses, while Gen Zers own only 1%--this all will change. The average age for starting a business is around age 35, so inevitably, these percentages will increase. According to a recent Prosper Insights and Analytics survey, over 10% of Gen Zers polled said they plan on starting or developing their own businesses in the next six months. Perhaps even more significant, numerous surveys and studies demonstrate that this generation rejects or at least resists traditional work structures. They desire balance and fulfillment from their jobs, and they want to be passionate about what they do. Entrepreneurship provides the best path to achieve these objectives. The new marketplaces dovetail with Gen Z consciousness. They provide less risky ways to launch a business than in the past. Distributed work and enabling technologies allow people to stay in current jobs while testing a new business concept",

In a world where many populations are aging and declining numerically, the new marketplaces provide wonderful opportunities for baby boomers who still want to work�or who need to work for financial reasons. The combination of facilitating technologies and emerging business opportunities provides older workers with the chance to work past traditional retirement age. It also offers them the chance to translate talents and experience into dynamic small businesses with a relatively minor financial investment. BIG CHANGES IN HOW PEOPLE WORK\r\r\tAs new marketplaces continue to emerge and multiply, they are having a profound effect on the nature of work, shattering traditional notions of how we define a job. Perhaps the two most significant changes involve the explosion of self-employed and gig workers, and the increasingly global nature of work. The following Pew Research graphic provides a dramatic snapshot of the former change:\r\r\r\r\t\r\tThe relatively high percentage of people doing gig work is obviously made possible by new marketplaces like ride-sharing and delivery apps, and these gigs are most appealing to younger workers. Less obviously, and perhaps more significantly, the rise in gig work is setting a precedent and a pattern. Instead of an anomaly, gig work is becoming an accepted part of the work landscape, and it�s bound to encompass more skilled tasks in the future. Shopify, Airbnb, Uber and other new marketplaces are also fueling the self-employment trend�the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 16. 9 million U. S. citizens were self-employed in October, 2022. Bloomberg reports that more Americans are self-employed than at any time since 2008",

THE FUTURE OF WORK IS GLOBAL\r\r\tThe new marketplaces also possess a global component, one that is different from the way we defined global business in the past. Years ago, we talked about multi-nationals establishing markets in places like China and South America and opening offices in various international locations. But global isn�t just about extending the brand or creating satellite foreign offices. The new marketplaces are inherently global, since the internet doesn�t recognize boundaries. Consider the following data:\r      At the end of 2021, of LinkedIn�s 875 million members and 58 million registered businesses, over 75% were from outside the U. S. China�s TikTok is the most popular website in the U. S. , but it�s also popular in Indonesia (100 million users), Brazil (75 million) and Russia (50 million). Amazon has over two million sellers, of which 40% are based in China. It�s not just that customers come from every corner of the world but that the new marketplaces make it possible for sellers to operate anywhere. Shopify generates half its business outside of the U. S. by enabling individuals in any country to sell in any other country that has the necessary resources (to handle translation, currency transfers, etc. ). Employees, too, can come from anywhere. IBM has more employees from India than the U. S. The people who keep the new marketplaces up and running don�t always need to work at headquarters, given that the very notion of headquarters may become an anachronism in the future. That future will increasingly be bits and not atoms as information, data and content can be moved around the world easily",

I know this from personal experience. When I came to Chicago from India over 40 years ago, I struggled to adjust to two things. The cold. And the bland food. Fortunately, I was able to adjust to the latter when I discovered tabasco sauce�I added it to everything. Now, Chicago and all U. S. cities have discovered spicy food. Global travel, food tv shows, immigration and other factors have changed people�s food shopping habits and what they order at restaurants. The same global mindset has spread to other sectors. The U. S. -centric or European-centric perspective is being replaced by a multi-polar global view that combines Western, Indian, Chinese, Latin and African influences. When companies limit their views to their own countries, they also limit their opportunities, since they can come from anywhere. FROM START-UP TO MEGA-CORP \r\r\tNever have so many small companies grown so big so fast. The new marketplaces are accelerating growth, turning businesses no one has heard of into household names, sometimes in a matter of months. As a result, people find themselves working for an informal operation where everyone knows everyone else one day, and the next they�re one of thousands of employees following rules and policies. Businesses are growing and scaling with unprecedented speed because of a number of factors, including massive infusion of money from venture capital and private equity. The new marketplaces, however, are fostering fast-scaling because they possess the following four capabilities:\r\r\t�Faster (than hardware) software. As software platforms, these marketplaces can iterate quickly. After they reach scale in the world of bits, they extend to the world of atoms. A good example: Amazon�s extension to real-world stores and its warehouses and delivery system. �Network effects.

Companies in this space use their ability to plug and play into each other and existing eco systems, relying on common software or Application Protocol Interfaces (such as app stores) to build on top of what has already been created. These capabilities are available to everyone through cloud-based marketplaces that connect, enable and empower small companies to scale themselves rapidly. As Web 3 technologies allow for more ownership, 5G allows for faster and more access to cloud-based computing and storage and AI provides magical superpowers to almost everyone, we are likely to see growth and scaling accelerate. More specifically, we can expect the following developments:\r\r1. More companies will be formed:  Marketplaces and modern technology is making it much easier to start a company. 2. Companies will scale even faster:  AI reduces the cost of development, 5G enables better and more cost-effective computing, more and more marketplaces offer plug and play solutions. 3.

Previously, I noted how Publicis is using the Marcel platform to plug and play into other platforms. They�ve also created what is essentially a new marketplace internally. Instead of looking outside for talent or free-lancers, they first make available projects and gigs to Publicis employees who possess relevant skills and are eligible for these types of gigs. This internal marketplace also saved over 2000 jobs during COVID, allowing Publicis companies in countries with excess talent to provide that talent to Publicis companies in other countries that were short of talent. In a way, this marketplace operated like an internal Upwork. Proctor & Gamble created a new marketplace for ideas called Connect and Develop. They identified needs in targeted categories and then anyone�individuals or companies�could apply to be considered as an innovation partner. This marketplace allowed P&G to reach out quickly, cut costs of development and expands its innovation team to potentially everyone in the world. LEVERAGING THE NEW MARKETPLACES\r\r\tAt a grassroots level, tech-savvy, entrepreneurial individuals have done a great job taking advantage of the new marketplaces.

Organizations, both large and small, can learn a lot from their pioneering efforts. It�s the larger companies, however, that have the most to gain when they leverage the new marketplaces.

This old scale, however, provides less of a competitive edge today than the scale of ideas, data, networks and talent. 2. Learn new skills and combine them with old ones. This is the �roots-and-wings� approach. At least some of the old skills and knowledge will still be valuable in the new paradigm, including a company�s brands, the defining stories and the relationships. But it�s also critical to be aware of how new marketplaces function and the capabilities necessary to maximize them. Microsoft has done an excellent job in this regard, maintaining its roots by refocusing on productivity software and business. But it�s also soared with its wings, moving business to the Cloud and embracing Linus and writing software for competing marketplaces and companies like Meta Quest and Apple. 3. Manage hybrid cultures. Most fast-growing companies are combining full-time, part-time and contracted employees, shuffling various labor marketplaces. Mastering this mix is crucial, the diversity of resources fostering fast growth and just-in-time talent onboarding. The challenge of managing hybrid cultures means maintaining product quality and blending connected cultures. 4. Address talent burnout. In the accelerated world of new marketplaces, this is a real risk that must be monitored and managed. Customer expectations for faster speeds combined with a fast-growing company (with the accompanying avalanche of stimuli and data) create an environment where people are highly stressed. If this stress isn�t managed, burnout happens. 5. Create Fractionalized Employees. I�ve saved the best for last.

This fractionalized employee should receive work/time options: 100%, 75% or 50% of their time (the last percentage the minimum needed for health and other benefits), and they can vary the percentage based on life events (health concerns, birth of a child and so on). With the implementation of a fractionalized employee policy, people no longer have to choose between staying or going or being torn trying to do two things at one time. If they wish to try out a different type of non-competitive job (starting a gaming company, working for the social good, or writing a book) employers should accommodate them because retaining half or three quarters of a talented person is better than zero. And there will be cost savings from reduced compensation as well as eliminating the cost of severance, re-hiring, and training (plus the hidden cost of the morale-depleting loss of a good employee). Just as important, fractionalized employee policies will probably attract a lot of talent who may want to work 50 to 75 percent of their time as well as allow companies to retain talent, grow talent, mix, and match talent in ways that are truly win-win. Chapter 4�GIG WORK, SIDE HUSTLES, PASSION PROJECTS\r\r\tIn Japan, the term Sh. shin koy. means permanent employment, and until relatively recently, it was standard practice. Companies offered the security of lifetime jobs in exchange for employee loyalty and hard work. In the U. S. and other countries, a similar �bargain� existed in the 20th century and into the early 21st century. Large, blue chip employers such as General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, IBM and others offered their own version of Sh. shin koy.

This is going to happen even if some organizational leaders don�t like it. The challenge will be adapting the organization to these changing employee preferences. DEFINING AND DESCRIBING THE NEW WORK MODES\r\r\tThe gig economy has grown in the last 20 years, and it has grown exponentially during COVID. It has produced two types of gigs: side hustles and side gigs. The former usually begins as a passion project. A marketing executive writes a play. Someone in HR creates handicrafts. An IT person develops a video game. An accountant in the financial department begins making furniture. They pursue these interests outside of work hours and don�t make any money from them initially. Eventually, though, opportunities present themselves; or they develop greater expertise that raises the quality of their work; or they need to find a way to monetize their passion project. Whatever the reason, they find a way to generate some income from what was formerly a hobby. It becomes a side hustle, their own small business that they run (or something they do as a contractor) in addition to their main job. A side gig differs from a side hustle in two ways. First, it�s done primarily for income. Second, it involves working for someone else (Uber, Task Rabbit, etc. ) rather than for oneself. Variations exist",

WHY THE GIG ECONOMY IS BOOMING\r\r\tPeople have always pursued passion projects, worked part-time jobs and turned hobbies into income. What�s different now that in our post-COVID world of distributed and unbundled work, side hustles and side gigs are facilitated. Just as important, many people�especially the younger generations�are not willing to settle for the types of jobs and working paradigms their parents embraced. More specifically, here are three factors that are driving the gig economy:\r\r\t�New types of jobs/ways of working. Mobile phones and the internet have atomized work, breaking down some full-time jobs into smaller gigs. For instance, instead of having to obtain a medallion to drive a taxi in major cities, people can now work for Uber part-time. Or sites like Upwork and Fivrr create a digital pathway to freelance work. Or Esty, an online marketplace, helps users monetize a passion for creating arts and crafts. Or Shopify gives individuals the tools to set up their own virtual store. �More freedom and flexibility. A growing number of people are working away from the office (full-time or part-time). This provides the freedom to pursue other jobs and the flexibility to juggle side hustles. People who work from home also save significant amounts of time�the long commute to the office, the lunches and drinks after work. It�s natural to take advantage of this freedom and flexibility to generate more income or spend more time doing what you love. �Financial pressure",

Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, released results from a recent (December, 2022) survey that reinforces the notion that people are more motivated than in the past to pursue side hustles and side gigs. For instance, they found that more than half the folks who have second jobs wouldn�t be able to pay their bills without this additional income. They also found that between 68% and 78% (the percentages varied based on size of company worked for) of survey respondents said that layoffs have made freelance work more attractive than in years past. A November, 2022 Lending Tree survey also found that 44% of Americans have a side hustle, up from 13% in 2020, and that an astonishing 62% of Gen Zers have a side hustle. NOT A PASSING FANCY BUT A GROWING TREND\r\r\tThere is no going back. We�re not going to return to a pre-COVID 9-to-5 office routine. While some pundits may predict a return to normal as COVID fears fade, the reality is that a new normal has emerged and isn�t going away. Here�s why:\r\r\t�The aphrodisiac of flexibility. After tasting the freedom of working where and when they wanted, many employees have no desire to revert to a more restrictive work environment. Mothers and other caretakers of small children in particular have benefitted, being able to find a better balance between work and parenting. Some hated the headaches of commuting and prefer working from home, while others enjoy doing their tasks without being locked into a rigid office structure where they�re continuously supervised. No doubt, some employees miss the camaraderie of being in communal workspaces, but this need for human connection can be met via alternative work environments and coming into the office occasionally. �The work ethic of older folks",

They work for identity, community and personal growth. Their desire to keep working�whether starting a small business or gig work�is filling employee ranks at places like Uber and creating online companies in many different fields. �Tech works. As I�ve discussed previously, tech innovations connect people to powerful resources for little or no cost (AI), let them be �present� in many places (5G/AR/VR) and find ways to monetize their work (Web 3).

In the past, such a concept was heretical. Today, it�s a win-win for organizations and employees. First, such a policy attracts and retains talent. Think of it as a perk that not only will bring in top people to the organization but provide an incentive for them to stay. Second, allowing people to pursue side hustles and gigs fosters skill and reputation development. Employees broaden their knowledge and competencies, and at the same time, they may become well-known because of their second or third jobs and be viewed as �stars�, attracting other talent to the company and enhancing its reputation. Third, and perhaps the most overlooked benefit, is related to costs. When you allow employees to work on other projects, start businesses and work part-time for others, you are essentially giving them a raise that doesn�t come out of your pocket. Without these side gigs and hustles, at least some of the most talented employees would either demand raises or leave the company for higher-paying jobs elsewhere. Given these three benefits, organizational leaders may recognize the value of policy change but wonder how to implement it. Fortunately, three industries provide good models that others can learn from: Entertainment/Hollywood, journalism and academia. When you stop and think about how Hollywood businesses are structured, you realize that they�re an unusual mix of gig work, long-term deals, side hustles and other alternative approaches. Many Hollywood employees are gig workers since the unit of work is inherently a gig�a television show, a movie, etc. To produce this unit of work, a company or companies gather people with the right combination of skills, and then everyone disbands once the production is complete, coming together against at some point in the future for the next gig",

Universities also provide their people with options to pursue side hustles and gigs. Tenured professors are allowed and often encouraged to do research, write books and articles and speak at conferences and given sabbaticals for this purpose. Professors in certain disciplines�business, computer science, engineering, medicine�often moonlight as consultants and their income from consulting may be more than their university salaries. Certain professors also can start their own companies, using university research facilities as a base. In some instances, professors join institutes associated with the university or independent from it to pursue a particular field of study, often with financial benefits for the professor and the university. Admittedly, universities, journalistic publications and the entertainment industry can provide these various job options because the work is easily compartmentalized.

Though they might not have an official policy about side hustles and passion projects, they provide de facto opportunities for employees to focus on other activities during work hours. Just by saving them commuting time two or three days a week, they open up the schedule for other pursuits. �Four-day work week. This experiment in gaining popularity in a number of industries, and it usually involves no work on Friday.

It�s a great option for employees who have side gigs that compensate them well or are committed to pursuing work about which they�re passionate. And it�s a great option for a company, in that two talented people can provide more knowledge and skills than one, resulting in greater productivity.

For this reason, we had Tim spend half his time starting a new unit of Starcom IP called Play, focused on gaming. The other half of his time would be devoted to the launch of his new company. Because he was both creating a gaming company and helping clients enter the gaming world, he would be more credible and connected to this world than anyone else in our company. We reduced his compensation by half but retained his health benefits so he didn�t have to worry about a lack of insurance for his family. Our arrangement with him also allowed him to receive some income while investing in a business. Starcom saved half of his salary, giving us the money to hire another gaming-focused employee who Tim could train and would be available full time for our clients. Play was a major success, helping clients like GM navigate the world of gaming, and we retained Tim for three more years before he switched full time to his entrepreneurial endeavors which he continues to work on today. Our willingness to be flexible with Tim gave us a model for use with other talented employees. We used it to attract world class talent and then use variations of the model to launch units built around the passion of some of our key talent: Reverb, a unit focused on social media long before Twitter or Facebook, and Digits, a group that specialized in mobile before the iPhone.

The company believes a business benefit exists when side hustles are allowed. They value the entrepreneurial experience of employees who start their own businesses, and find that these employees can apply this learning to their work at Rebel Business School. As CEO Tom Paine put it in an interview with CNBC, �If the majority of the team have got their own experience of starting and failing, starting and succeeding�when they have conversation with the participants of our course, they�re coming from a place of experience and therefore, they�ve got more credibility. �\r\tThis same CNBC story also focused on Tribal Digital, a digital agency that encourages side hustles.

Perhaps more importantly, they need to address the underlying organizational attitudes that are counterproductive in the gig economy era:\r1) A breakdown in trust between employer and employee. 2) A belief that employees belong to employers during working hours. 3) A measurement mismatch where companies believe they are buying hours while employees believe they are delivering outcomes. Failing to trust employees to do their main jobs well because they have side hustles and gigs is counterproductive. It betrays a 20th century management paranoia about workers�if you give them an inch, they�ll take a mile. The best 21st century companies trust that their people will be sufficiently professional and adult to balance their commitments. They rely on communication and flexibility to ensure that the company and the employee thrive in the current environment. Side gig or hustles may demand a greater time commitment from an employee than expected. Savvy organizations recognize this might happen, and to prevent it from being a deal-breaker, they request that employees inform management when they get enmeshed in their second jobs and work out a plan to ensure that their main work gets done effectively. For organizations that remain skeptical about trusting their people in this environment, let me suggest that side hustles, especially, increase employee commitment to their main jobs for three reasons: \r\r�Appreciation:  People are grateful to organizations for providing them with a steady income and insurance benefits as well as the chance to work at something that they love.

Still, organizations should follow certain steps that will facilitate the transition to a gig-friendly culture. Specifically, here are four steps that should prove effective for both employees and employers:\r\r1) Discussion of mutual benefits: Both employer and employee should specify the lay out benefits from employees� side-hustles and passion projects�the benefits for both parties. When both groups understand what�s in it for them, they�ll be more motivated to make the new system function effectively. 2) Expectations of Deliverables: What are the employee deliverables, outcomes and standards. An employee should have clarity on expectations. What work needs to be delivered (e. g. , products created, clients visited etc. ), What outcomes will be measured and are expected (e. g. , Revenue generated) and what standards must be met (e. g. , 99% reliability, client satisfaction scores).

While this is obviously true, the ramifications of the COVID era are more far-reaching and complex than a growing number of employees working off-site. COVID not only accelerated trends that had developed prior to the pandemic but provided the spark for new trends. It changed not only how we worked but forced us to re-examine long-held assumptions about why we work. And it provided evidence a new way of working was not only possible, but productive and profitable. There is no going back. Just as COVID gave us new tools to fight infectious disease, it also showed us a better way to work. HOW COVID CHANGED WORK IN FIVE WAYS\r\r\tBefore the pandemic, the work paradigm was already evolving. Flattened organizational structures, open offices, flexible working hours and other innovations were reshaping the workplace. COVID, however, not only accelerated and embedded these and other changes but gave birth to new concepts. Specifically, here are the five most significant areas of change that COVID catalyzed:\r\r5) Where we work. This is the most obvious transformation",

Few white-collars jobs that can be done remotely will return to full-time office status. Yes, some companies have demanded their employees return to the office at least part of the time. But we�re never going to see the old paradigm restored. Consider that only 50% of office buildings in San Francisco are occupied, and that New York City office rents have declined from 15% to 30% because of unused capacity. Before COVID, business leaders were skeptical about remote work. COVID, though, was the ultimate litmus test. It offered irrefutable proof that people could work as or more effectively outside the office. 6) How we work. COVID taught everyone to Zoom. It created a comfort level with virtual meetings that had not existed previously. It helped people discover the value of project management from Salesforce and Asana. People adopted and adapted to technology out of necessity, and once they did, few wanted to return to less efficient and effective ways of doing and communicating about work. 7) When we work. The pandemic made 9-to-5 an anachronism. It turned some weekends into work days and weekdays into non-work time. It created the realization that different people work best at different times�some are highly productive in the middle of the night while others are most creative at dawn. Liberated from the tyranny of the standard work week, people can adjust their schedules to their natural work rhythms. A recent Stanford University study used geolocation data near U. S. golf courses and found that 278% more people were playing golf on Wednesday at 4:00 p. m. in August 2022 than in August 2019. No doubt, more people are going to health clubs in the middle of the day, attending afternoon movies and watching their kids play sports. They�re also working at other times when they used to be relaxing. Instead of our life fitting around work, work is increasingly fitting around our lives",

As a result, managers had to re-invent themselves and develop new skills. Pre-COVID, a great deal of their time was spent managing by walking around the office. Without the physical presence of employees, managers have been forced to re-think how they train and mentor people as well as how they inculcate corporate culture. Employees, too, need to make adjustments if they want to be managed differently. Sarah Hoffsteter, President of Profitero, a board member of Campbell�s Soup and someone I admire greatly, has this to say on the subject: �If employees want less management, more autonomy and more flexibility, employers need to have the confidence that the employee is able to work independently, has the resilience for self-motivation and the intellect to know when the ask for support��\r\rAnother issue, of course, is whether as much management is needed today as pre-COVID. The flattening of organizations that began a number of years ago and picked up steam during the pandemic is likely to continue. And then there�s �de-bossification�. This means a decline in managers, controllers, monitors, evaluators and paper pushers. COVID gave a lot of employees a taste of life without an omnipresent boss, and now many people want to make this their regular diet. Companies like Meta have been assessing why they have so many layers of managers and whether these layers add sufficient value to offset the way they slow down processes and add costs. As organizations flatten, at least some of these managerial positions will be eliminated. 9) Why we work. COVID jarred us into thinking differently or at least more deeply about the meaning of work. Until COVID, many of us didn�t think a lot about why we work. We were the victims of inertia�we fell into routines and followed them unthinkingly until something forced us to examine these routines",

For that reason, Capital One began offering everything from on-campus health care centers�including access to affordable mental health care for associates and their families�to dedicated days that encourage focus on personal and professional development. Plenty of companies went remote during the worst of the pandemic and have now defaulted to either a hybrid arrangement or brought everyone back full time.

POSITIVE RESULTS\r\r\tNot every company has followed the lead of Dropbox, Capital One and TomTom. A significant number of organizations have attempted to restore the status quo after the pandemic. Understandably, they find the emerging work paradigm unfamiliar and more than a little scary. Perhaps it would be less scary if they understood that COVID-catalyzed changes have improved the workplace in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most positive outcome has been increased productivity. Contrary to many experts� expectations in COVID�s early days, people are often more productive when working remotely. In the Conference Board�s three-year tracking study, they determined that as company leaders and managers get their minds around the need for hybrid working environments and create responsive processes and structures, their people become more productive:\r\r\r\r\r      A recent University of Birmingham study of 597 managers has shed light on how managers� attitudes towards the hybrid work model have changed as a result of the pandemic, revealing an increasingly positive outlook toward remote and flexible working.

This suggests that managers are starting to recognize that giving employees more control over when and where they work can lead to better performance. That same Conference Board study also showed increased flexibility in hiring because of the pandemic, and that this flexibility benefits both organizations and their employees. Before the pandemic, 46 percent of surveyed HC leaders indicated that their organizations were not willing to hire virtual employees, and 8 percent were willing in the U. S. or globally. Now 49 percent are willing to hire 100 percent virtually, a six-fold increase. The flexibility not only makes it easier to attract talent but helps organizations acquire more diverse talent since they�re recruiting from a much larger pool. While COVID wasn�t solely responsible for company cultures becoming kinder and gentler, the toll that the pandemic took caused many leaders to take a step back and think about what�s important�in work and in life. As a result, cultures have become more open�leaders are more receptive to listening to their people, to the need for work/life balance and to creating more diverse workplaces. Time magazine interviewed representatives of three very different companies in three very different industries (JBS, the world�s largest global poultry producer; LinkedIn; and Jones Soda) to learn how their cultures had evolved.

The changes that picked up steam during COVID are permanent, especially the following shifts: \r\r\t�Much more remote-only work. Many companies will offer more fully remote jobs than before the pandemic. Currently, these jobs are three times more than the pre-pandemic level. �Hybrid becomes the norm. Relatively few companies are insisting that all their employees return to five-days, 9-to-5 schedules. For many organizations, two to three days in the office has become the norm. �Greater use of technology to enable distributed work. A McKinsey study determined that COVID accelerated the roll-out of technology by seven to ten years; that one year into COVID, many companies had digitally enabled 80% of customer interactions. Despite these shifts, some business leaders continue to insist that people must return full-time to the office to preserve culture, to maintain product and service quality, to maximize team effectiveness and to facilitate hiring and training processes. When people insist on this old paradigm, I cite three advantages of the new work protocols during COVID:\r\r\t�Larger pools of talent.

For many companies, it was startling to realize that their businesses could still run well with a smaller budget. Suddenly, what once was seen as necessary spending seemed to be overspending. �Future flexibility. During COVID, we entered the Third Connected Age of Technology. With the start of remote work, organizations were driven to implement new technologies and teach their people to use them. Without virtual meeting apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, organizations would have struggled to bring their employees together to discuss and decide on key issues. Instead of having people work with 2008 technology (which companies were doing in 2019), organizations capitalized on tech innovations during COVID and prepared their workforces for the future. The tools developed over the last few years give organizations great flexibility in terms of hiring, integrating full and part-time and remote workers, partnering with diverse groups and so on.

Understandably, it�s difficult to imagine a time when many organizations have these hybrid employees�people who work 50% or 75% of the time but are provided with the benefits of full-time staff. As of this writing, at least, this employee type remains an exception rather than the rule in many companies. I feel confident, though, that this prediction will come to pass. Part of my confidence is because of various trends and changing attitudes, which I�ll detail. Part of it, though, is based on my own experience. In June of 2018, I stopped working full time at Publicis Groupe after a 37-year career. For the next year, I worked only 50 percent of the time with half my compensation but remained an employee of the company with full health insurance and many other long-term benefits. I used the other half of my time to write my first book. As a free-lancer or as a contract employee I would not have retained employment nor the full-time employee benefits which I continued to enjoy. You may also recall the story I told in Chapter 4 about Tim Harris, a highly valued employee earlier in my career. Tim decided he wanted to start a gaming company, and to avoid losing him, I created a plan where he could pursue his passion project while at the same time retaining employment with our Starcom IP; he would work half of the time but receive full benefits like other employees (the healthcare benefits were especially important, since Tim had small children at the time). The arrangement worked out great both for both Tim and Starcom IP. Admittedly, Tim�s story and my own represent a small sample size for a big prediction. Therefore, we need to look at the many other compelling factors that shape my perspective. First, though, let�s define clearly what a fractionalized employee is and might become",

We need to look beneath the surface, however, to understand what this new employee type signifies and why it�s so well-suited to the current environment. Consider how the traditional work model forces people to make impossible decisions: between staying at a company they love or leaving to pursue a passion project; between returning to work a few weeks or months after having a child or quitting the job and staying home. Clearly, a hybrid employment policy benefits individuals who are caught on the horns of this dilemma. Though I�ll address the employer benefits of the fractionalized model in detail later in this chapter, for now recognize that it helps organizations attract and retain talent, reduce costs and motivate people to concentrate on the tasks at hand. Despite these benefits, many companies have shied away from implementing fractionalized policies with the exception of businesses in Europe and Australia. In the latter, up to a quarter of part-time employees receive full benefits (primarily funded and driven by high taxes and social nets). Nonetheless, some early adopters have recognized the value of the fractionalized employee concept. The retail industry, including companies such as Starbucks, Costco, Chipotle and REI offer insurance, stock, 401(k)s and educational stipends to anyone who works more than 20 to 30 hours weekly. Non-retailers have been slow to recognize the value of this policy, in part because they didn�t feel the tradeoffs were worth it�the cost, the administrative difficulty and fear of turnover and lack of dedication to the job",

SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM\r\r\tIn the last few years, people have started to rethink long-held assumptions about work. As I�ve noted, more people are working less than full-time (as freelancers or part-time contractors) as they try to achieve work-life balance or focus on side hustles and gigs. AI is beginning to boost productivity and eliminate much rote and process work, enabling companies to reduce employee hours and employees to earn higher salaries for fewer hours of work. The parallel with Ford Motor Company�s innovation in 1914 is instructive. When Ford automated their assembly lines, they doubled worker pay to $5 an hour as well as created an 8-hour day. Ford shifted everyone�s perspective on work, just as AI is doing. Combine the work-life balance issue, the desire for side hustles and gigs with AI and an aging workforce, and you can see how a significant shock is being delivered to the system�a shock that is felt by entry level workers as well as senior executives. The fractionalized employee concept can help everyone weather this shock but only if three criteria are met: \r\r\r1) Mutual Benefit: Fractionalized employment will only make sense when both the employer and the employee can benefit from such an arrangement. People don�t want a system that imposes half-time work on them when they want to work full-time. Companies don�t want a system where they are creating part-time jobs for tasks that require full-time staff. 2) Type of job: Some jobs can be done half time and others cannot. For instance, demanding clients and customers will not accept an account person who is available only 50% of the time. Similarly, an executive with many full-time direct reports cannot be a good supervisor if she is unavailable two or three days a week",

If you�re in HR, you�re probably already fretting about all the forms and new policies that must be put in place to handle benefits-receiving employees who only work part of the time.

The false logic here is that if you aren�t working full time, you�re not fully invested in the job. As a former manager of fractionalized employees and one myself for a year, I found that we felt fortunate to have this opportunity; we were grateful to have our cake and eat it too. Our gratitude translated into eagerness to pay back the company for this opportunity. We had a good reason to be more dedicated than most. Fractionalized workers have skin in the game, unlike a freelancer or contractor. Because they receive benefits, they possess a long-term perspective�they want to sustain the relationship for years, not weeks or months, and are motivated to deliver excellent work. �Work and client/customer relationships will suffer. Yes, some clients and customers are demanding. Yes, some expect their key person to be available during traditional work hours (and sometimes, at other times also).

Most clients I know would insist on the former option. This is someone the client values highly, and even 50% of this value is better than no value at all. �Creates an exodus of talent. Perhaps this is true eventually. The fractionalized employee turns his passion project into a successful business and leaves the organization to devote all his hours to it. But a fractionalized policy also extends the time this employee is with the company. Generally, fractionalized employees require a few years before they can turn their part-time venture into a full-time one. This expectation also creates a window during which the company can prepare clients and customers for a valued employee�s departure as well as hire and train this person�s replacement. A GREAT BENEFITS POLICY\r\r\tThough the fractionalized employee concept is still in the beta testing phase at organizations that have adopted it, we know enough about its impact from their experiences to recognize the significant benefits�benefits that run the gamut, from cost savings to employee motivation. But the biggest benefit has to do with talent. The best companies, very much like the best sports teams, tend to have a disproportionate share of passionately aligned and improving talent striving to achieve a common outcome--customer satisfaction, superior products and services and great financial results. The real differentiator is talent. All things being equal, the better talent will win because it is talent that comes up with ideas, designs the products and provides the services that allow organizations to excel. The fractionalized option allows a business to attract a disproportionate share of talent that is passionate about their work",

Consider how fractionalized employees affect culture. They often see themselves as long-term rather than short-term employees, and as such are much more invested in the company than others. They�re also happier employees (as the earlier eating-their-cake-and-having-it-too analogy conveyed). And fractionalized employees also tend to be more diverse than the average; the fractionalized concept appeals to women, parents, the health-challenged and those caring for aging parents and spouses. The greater the diversity, the greater the creativity and ultimately, profit. Another benefit of fractionalized policies is efficiency. It reduces costs by bringing in and retaining expertise at 50/75% of full-time compensation rather than paying 100%. It also gives organizations the option to cut costs without layoffs, implementing a fractionalized strategy to reduce people�s workloads and compensation during tough times. A third benefit involves retaining key talent, especially among older employees and parents. At a time of aging and flattening populations, organizations are in danger of losing people with great institutional knowledge and expertise. These older employees may not want to work full time for health reasons, lack of financial need and a desire to pursue other interests. But if they were given the option of working less but still retaining health and other benefits, many of them would choose to remain with the company longer. Parents, too, would be given an incentive for remaining employees rather than to stay home full-time with their kids. The exodus of new moms from companies, especially, is a significant challenge for organizations attempting to find a good gender balance",

Fourth, organizations with fractionalized employees will become magnets for talent. They�ll not only have a competitive advantage over companies that don�t offer fractionalized work and draw from a wider populace, but they will attract a lot of bright, forward-thinking people�individuals who are looking ahead and see the possibility that at some point in the future, they might want to take advantage of the fractionalized way of working. WHERE AND HOW THE MODEL WILL WORK\r\r\tThe fractionalized employee model is applicable across many industries, companies and occupations, both white collar and some blue collar. The reason: Most companies whether they are in the knowledge, service or manufacturing sector will have a need to retain or attract specialists and other key people--senior folks within a company looking to slow down or experts seeking flexibility to pursue outside activities. Try an experiment: Examine the organization to which you belong and identify veteran employees who possess decades of experience or well-honed skills that are rare or irreplaceable. It might be a foreman who understands how all the machinery works (and what to do when it doesn�t work) better than anyone. It might be a hospital administrator who can cut through bureaucratic red tape with astonishing ease. Organizations don�t want to lose these �old salts�, and fractionalized employment can help retain them. This is especially true in developed countries with aging populations where there is a shortage of craftspeople, teachers, nurses, carpenters and not just computer scientists and doctors or other specialists",

These are often senior or other very talented folks. �Attraction: to attract talent some of whom may not wish to work full time. �Skill Enhancement:  to update knowledge and other competences as business changes. The half-life of knowledge in many industries is shrinking and often senior individuals need to go back into intensive training. Sometimes this may require one or two years of half-time training. The Fractionalized Employee does not have to give up income to learn new expertise and by being treated as an employee during their training period they are more likely to come back full time to the company. In different industries, these needs will manifest themselves in a variety of ways. It�s useful to examine three different industries to see why and how they�ll take advantage of the fractionalized concept. In manufacturing, for instance, there�s great concern about the aging workforce. A study by the Manufacturing Institute found that �most manufacturing firms are both aware and concerned about the aging of the manufacturing workforce�(they) are particularly concerned about the brain drain (i. e. the loss of institutional and technical knowledge)�firms across the manufacturing sector are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the aging workforce on their business. Almost 90 percent of companies surveyed reported capitalizing on the talents and experiences of their older workers��\r       A fractionalized program would provide manufacturers with access to experts who could train and mentor the next generation.

Nursing, for instance, is a field where employees (nurses) must be physically present and where demand for personnel outpaces supply. According to The American Nurses Association (ANA), more registered nurse jobs will be available through 2022 than any other profession in the United States. According to an article in the Nursing Times, The US Bureau of Labor Statistics�projects that more than 275,000 additional nurses are needed from 2020 to 2030. Employment opportunities for nurses are projected to grow at a faster rate (9%) than all other occupations from 2016 through 2026. Combine aging baby boomers in need of nursing services with nurse burnout (exacerbated by COVID) and you can understand why organizations from nursing homes to hospitals want to find a way to attract more nurses and keep their experienced practitioners. Now imagine if two nurses could share a shift either by being there for half a shift or on alternate days. This would ameliorate the problem of burn out and facilitate work-life balance. It could also provide nurses with time to get trained or generate additional income. The fractionalized employee model would retain many nurses who do not want to work full time and be able to bring in people who want to work part time. Because nursing responsibilities can be shared relatively easily, it would also accommodate two employees on fractionalized schedules. Teaching is another profession that could capitalize on fractionalized employees. Like nursing, teaching is experiencing a significant shortage. In an August 2022 paper, �Is There a National Teacher Shortage. �,�Tuan D. Nguyen�and�Chanh B.

They�re also dealing with relative low pay (many teachers love to teach but cannot afford to teach full time), training (new curriculum and skills require teachers to be constantly certified) and work/life balance (family and other issues). Because teachers can split courses or teach only a given semester or specific courses, the field lends itself to fractionalized employment, offering individuals the chance of doing a half or three quarters of the usual workload. It would also provide schools with a way to reduce costs, a significant concern in many school districts around the country. Again, fractionalized employment won�t work for every type of job in every field. Many service jobs in advertising, consulting and law, for instance, operate with client assumptions that their professionals will be available to them on demand. If you�re a business and can�t access your lawyer while you�re going through a major lawsuit, you�ll be understandably upset.

Clients tend to support this change because they realize that without this accommodation they would lose access to the talent and expertise completely and recognize how issues can be addressed with changed staffing and periodic check ins. FACILITATING IMPLEMENTATION\r\r\tOrganizations can do a lot to make the transition to fractionalized employees as seamless as possible. Here are three basic steps that everyone can take. First, recognize that a flexible-hour policy dovetails with the fractionalized approach. This means allowing work to be done at any time or within certain windows. Obviously, certain jobs require continuous presence over sustained time periods and flexibility isn�t possible for many doctors or teachers; they have to be in the hospital or classroom for continuous hours to help patients or students. It�s also difficult to be flexible with CEOs� hours, since they must be accessible to employees, media, analysts and other groups during traditional working hours. On the other hand, nurses, substitute teachers and even CFOs could (and often do) have flexible-hour jobs�two nurses can share a shift and substitute teachers are only available on certain days. While CFOs are key executives, many companies cannot afford or don�t need a full-time, world-class CFO. For them, retaining a highly competent but fractionalized CFO (with a strong, supportive staff) is better than having to settle for a mediocre (but less expensive) full-time substitute. Given that many jobs no longer require the daily physical presence of employees, flexibility is a relatively low bar for many organizations and jobs. Second, target jobs that can be divided into smaller assignments",

A software writer might focus on assignments that take advantage of his specific skills; an English Literature professor may choose to teach upper-level courses that concentrate on 19th century novels; an attorney may only be interested in doing research (rather than dealing with clients or appearing in court). When jobs can be broken into Lego-like pieces, companies will find it easier to combine different workers to achieve specific goals. Again, technological advances will make divisibility more practical than in the past. Machine augmentation will �projecticize� work, similar the way tasks are segmented in the consulting and entertainment industries. The growing need for highly specific expertise, too, will lend itself to divisibility. Third, delegate tasks. Most tasks require teams; one employee isn�t responsible for all the assignments. Teams working on a task can shift a fractionalized worker�s task responsibilities to another employee when that worker isn�t available. This delegation not only allows for continuity of work but if done well can grow others people�s skills so they can handle the task with the same expertise as the fractionalized person. On a more granular level, companies can enact policies and create rules that will maximize the advantages of fractionalized work. Ironically, given fractionalized employment�s flexibility, it requires the following rigid structures to succeed:\r\r\t�Processes. Limited Choices. Employees who wish to work less than full time but get full health benefits and pro-rated financial benefits such as bonuses or equity should be given only two alternative levels--50 percent of full time or 75 percent of full time.

An employee can only decide to change their percentage once a year during a particular two-week period�perhaps in September of the previous year for the following year. The only exception would be a major life or health event. This enables companies to forecast how many workers they will need and how work gets covered. It also enables far easier administration. Limited Eligibility. Being selective helps funnel high performing candidates into the fractionalized program, a key measure since the program is designed for the company�s best talent and those who are well-versed in the company�s culture and processes. To limit eligibility, the following criteria are useful: \r\r      Having a minimum number of years of service. For example, one must have worked in the company for at least two years full time before being eligible. Achieving a specific level of performance or a minimum rating level (only candidates with levels evaluation). Restricting eligibility.

All other cash compensation like bonuses and stock grants should be pro-rated to percentage of salary. While salary, bonus and stock can be pro-rated to percentage of time worked, health care benefits are at 100 percent and deductions are at 100 percent.

FOUR MOTIVATING FACTORS\r\r\tNow and especially in the future, who will apply for fractionalized employment. More specifically, let�s look at the four emerging factors that will motivate people to apply:\r\r\t�Family care. While different types of family issues can cause people to reduce their time at work, the two most common are eldercare and childcare. The former will be especially prevalent in the coming years as America ages rapidly�Millennials and others will face some tough choices. A combination of emotional reasons (a desire to look after their parents who looked after them) or financial needs (assisted care and home nursing being even more expensive in the coming years) causes many employees to face a difficult either-or choice: continue working full time to pay for care or leave a job to care for their family members. The latter choice may not be feasible, however, if they still need an income. They may also find great satisfaction in their job and hate the prospect of leaving it entirely. Fractionalized employment, therefore, makes senses for these individuals on two different levels. A similar situation exists with childcare choices. While many parents (usually mothers) return to work after maternity leave, many of them find it emotionally difficult to be away from their children. In addition, full-time childcare is becoming more expensive, and so there�s a financial burden as well. The fractionalized option is a good compromise for many parents",

Upskilling is becoming crucial in many professions. The need to develop better technology skills or become familiar with new developments in a given field or function is common, and this need can be met through training programs as well as advanced degree school programs. The problem, of course, is that completing these degrees or programs requires a great deal of time. Given intense work schedules, many people lack the energy or inclination to juggle a job and school. A better choice is continuing to be an employee half time, balancing school and work as a fractionalized employee. They can also practice what they learn in school at their jobs and continue to generate income for school fees and living. �Exploration of other interests. As I�ve discussed, a growing number of employees have side hustles�everything from passion projects to start-ups. Given that the world is changing�that it�s becoming normative to juggle two or three different jobs to make money and pursue meaningful work�it makes sense that people want to find a way to achieve this end. Keeping a job while exploring their passions generates both income and work connections, and it also allows people to build their skills or a business for the future. �End of Career Transition. Cold turkey retirement is a relic of an old paradigm. Transitioning to retirement gradually while still working is more reflective of many people�s goals, especially baby boomers. Especially this baby boomer. As I�ve described, I became a fractionalized employee at Publicis for my last year there, shifting to 50 percent time before becoming an advisor.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS\r\r\tTechnological advancements have always raised the specter of job loss. In the agricultural age, modern combine tractors allowed one person to do the work of many; fewer people were needed to work the farm. In the Industrial Age, cars eliminated the horse and carriage business and big companies with their superior technology drove smaller ones who couldn�t afford that technology out of business. With each technological innovation, some people lost their jobs and some critics raised fears of what the new era might bring. In the late 1950s, especially, people were terrified of �automation�. Companies like General Electric made major commitments to automating factories, creating conflicts with unions that felt these commitments endangered union member jobs. And of course, there were some job losses as various machines took over jobs formerly done by humans. But new jobs were created because of the machines�someone needed to help companies use the machines effectively. Throughout history, we�ve worried about machines replacing people. Today, however, this worry is especially acute given utterances of influential people like Alibaba�s Jack Ma. This is from a speech he gave in 2017 at a conference in China: \"In 30 years, a robot will likely be on the cover of Time Magazine as the best CEO. � He warned of dark times ahead for people who are unprepared for the upheaval technology is set to bring, explaining that robots are quicker and more rational than humans, Ma said, and they don't get bogged down in emotions -- like getting angry at competitors. But he expressed optimism that robots will make life better for humans in the long run. \"Machines will do what human beings are incapable of doing,\" Ma said. \"Machines will partner and cooperate with humans, rather than become mankind's biggest enemy",

It is never machine/software/technology versus person but machine/software/technology plus person. OVERCOMING OUR FEAR \r\r\tPerhaps you read the previous section and thought to yourself: �Easy for you to write; you don�t have to tell 1000 employees they no longer have jobs because there is software, robots and AI that can do their jobs faster, better and for less money. �\r\tI understand that it�s not easy. I also understand the fear, since change can be frightening. Many people talk to me about how AI doesn�t just augment our physical and communication skills but is capable of learning them and doing them much better and faster. Things that take us days to accomplish, AI can get done in minutes. People justifiably fear this hyper-productivity, convinced that it will lead to widespread unemployment or diminish their roles and value to their companies. As I�ve noted, new technology has always changed the nature of work, the skills we need, where we work and much more. Perhaps what�s different about today�s machines is that they don�t look or work like the big, inanimate objects of the past; they seem almost human. Today, AI and robotics possess astonishing pattern recognition and language capabilities, suggesting they�re poised to replace us, no matter what our occupation might be. Modern machines seem to be so alive and adept that they will make humans irrelevant, similar to the ways in which tractors replaced horses and e-mails replaced faxes. What we have here is both a failure of imagination and understanding, creating unnecessary panic. If we can shift our perspective�if we can focus on what technology can do for us rather than what it is doing to us�then we grasp how this new machine age can benefit everyone",

But it will do so only if we rely on qualities that even the best new technology lacks. HUMANS MUST BECOME MORE HUMAN\r\r\tThere�s no denying that job descriptions from 2019 bear little resemblance to those from 2023�and that job descriptions in 2026 will be quite different from the present. Over recent decades, computers, mobile devices and the internet have catalyzed changes in how we work. But more recent developments are having profound effects on many industries. In the creative arts, for instance, modern computing and software have raised video, sound and special effects capabilities, elevating the quality and range of tools but also necessitating different approaches to work. Streaming platforms provide a variety of new ways to distribute and monetize work, and crowd funding helps artists raise money in fresh ways. Open AI, Mid Journey and Runway, applied research and generative AI companies, enhance authors� abilities to research, illustrate, create and ideate, distributing incredibly powerful tools to everyone. Developments such as these are taking place in many fields, and they will have the same impact as the internet has had on business. AI is the same sort of game-changer�more to the point, it�s a job-changer. IBM�s chief commercial officer, Rob Thomas, has a great quote about AI that sends a message every organization should heed: �AI may not replace managers. But managers that use AI will replace the managers that do not. �\r\tAt the same time, managers that use AI and also are more creative, empathic and curious will replace the managers who are over-reliant on AI and other tech tools",

In the future, we�people and machines�must double down on what we do best. Machines must take on more computational, pattern, research and data tasks, while we must draw on our distinctly human traits. To be human is to be variable and experience different moods, to imagine, to speculate and to feel. A machine cannot say why it created what it did; we can. Every business leader should be helping their people transition to this quickly-approaching future. To do so, they need to help employees upgrade their skills in three areas: \r\r\r      �Tech knowledge. This isn�t just for IT. In fact, it�s even more important for non-tech employees. Too often, the marketing or HR people focus only on using the tech rather than figuring out how to use it better; they profess ignorance of everything except basic usage, calling for IT support at the first sign of trouble. A better approach is to provide a wide swath of employees with an understanding of how to use modern technology including AI. Educate them about how to ask questions to understand a given technology�s limitations, learning how to work with the tech productively. �Synergies. How can a user enhance the effectiveness of a piece of technology. How can people use their relationships, common sense, creativity and knowledge of the company�s culture to leverage the technology, to turbo charge it. Yes, machines will be able to create white papers and speeches for executives, but a writer with a point of view and a voice will build and adapt what machines produce, adding depth and insight and eloquence",

Training people to do more than just know how to use machines is key; training them to draw upon the abilities that machines lack can increase their productivity dramatically. �Options. Given that technology will eliminate some jobs and change many more, companies must help people learn to work differently. This may mean setting up training programs for people to acquire new skills and knowledge. It may mean providing an understanding of how people can use all the extra time they have, now that machines are doing their mundane tasks. It definitely means coaching people to be flexible, to be willing to adjust to working more closely with technology than they did in the past. WHAT PEOPLE DO BETTER THAN MACHINES\r\r\tAs I�ve emphasized, people possess qualities that even the best AI lacks�empathy, creativity, relationship-building, leadership and so on. These qualities translate into on-the-job behaviors and ideas that benefit organization in many ways�ways that even the most state-of-the-art technology can�t duplicate. Before discussing these qualities, here are three things that machines can do better than people:\r\r      �Research and categorize large amounts of data. �Summarize and provide analyses and recommendations. �Offer a range of creative solutions involving words, images, and videos. Nonetheless, organizations persist in having their people do at least some of these tasks. Not only aren�t people as good as machines when it comes to these assignments, they don�t find this type of work particularly fulfilling. Most of these tasks are rote or require an arduous attention to detail, and both the individual and the organization would be better served by ceding these jobs to technological devices",

For instance, earlier I described how Shopify helps its customers with no or little technological expertise sell products in many markets for far less money than is traditionally required. Now, Shopify is using new AI technology to help its customers in other ways�providing merchants with superior search tools that function like a personal shopper, writing copy promoting their merchandise with a single click (termed �Shopify magic�). Merchants modify and personalize what the AI creates. This symbiosis between merchant and machine is the future, and it is the same human-tech symbiosis that will eventually exist in all organizations. It stands to reason that if a machine can enhance the outcome by either doing it cheaper or faster or better, organizations will optimize and allocate more work to automation especially if the work is repetitive, boring and does enhance or build skills. At the same time, no matter how much organizations come to depend on their technology, they will be even more dependent on people for the following three qualities that they can provide and machines can�t:\r\r      �Differentiation.

Apple uses production lines at Foxconn which many of their competitors also use and most of the raw materials are similar or purchased from competitors (screens from Samsung or LG), but their design, branding and storytelling allow Apple to charge more, and it is one of the most distinctive and successful brands because of its very human ingenuity. For a company known as tech innovators, their most obvious point of differentiation (arguably) isn�t their silicon chips but the stunning look of their iPhones and other devices. �New and improved thinking. Machines tend to learn and optimize based on pre-sets of learning data or pre-programmed algorithms. They adapt but are unable to recognize if the landscape has changed either due to competition or new customer needs.

In service businesses where people-to-people interactions are essential, AI remains incapable of doing what even barely competent people can do. Whether the field is dentistry, food service or delivery, people want to interact with other people. Most of us want to meet with our accountants, financial planners, lawyers and therapists about important issues rather than be �serviced� by a machine, no matter how smart it might be. Now and especially in the future, people will continue to seek other people to talk to, guide them, or enhance their experience. There is no substitute for looking someone in the eye before making a commitment to them.

I�m not disagreeing that the advertising and marketing world has benefitted from technological advances�search engine optimization, social media tools and so on. Interestingly, however, the number of people working in the field has increased despite certain tasks formerly undertaken by people now handled by machines. That�s because as soon as you optimize one part of media technologically, another breakthrough occurs requiring analysis, integration and new approaches�jobs that people do best. Service, therefore, is always going to require a human element, and not just for dealing directly with customers. Service businesses often must grapple with the unpredictable, the emotional and the illogical. People get that, and machines don�t.

Moore�s law of the processor age of doubling capability every 18 months is so snail-like slow compared to what we are seeing currently.

Because of AI and Deep Fake technology, it is possible to put words in the mouth of an individual or create a video that integrates the likeness of that person (without their permission). This technology can have an adverse effect on privacy, reputations and finances. Will a competitive company in Russia (for example) smear a U. S. company�s reputation.

When higher-paid managers begin losing their jobs, however, sparks will fly.

No more. �The jobs lost in a monthslong cascade of white-collar layoffs triggered by overhiring and rising interest rates might never return, corporate executives and economists say. Companies are rethinking the value of many white-collar roles, in what some experts anticipate will be a permanent shift in labor demand that will disrupt the work life of millions of Americans whose jobs will be lost, diminished or revamped partly through the use of artificial intelligence. �\r\tBusiness leaders need to think long and hard about the roles of managers (a topic of a later chapter)",

The third issue goes beyond �mere� concern about jobs to apocalyptic thinking: Will AI be responsible for the destruction of life as we know it. Whether it�s the end of corporate life or the death of our species, this is scary stuff. Many leading AI researchers are concerned that exponentially increasing capabilities of AI combined with the all-out competition between large companies or countries such as China and the US to �win AI� will obviate rules and regulations that keep AI in check. As much as this might sound like a bad science fiction movie, the fear is that AI will evolve so quickly that it will take over systems, refusing to take orders and subjugating or destroying humankind. On a Lex Fridman podcast, AI expert Eliezer Yudkowsky said this about AI�s rapid development: �They spit out gold, until they get large enough and ignite the atmosphere and kill everybody.

Would you ask them to come occasionally to the office for other reasons�collaboration, relationship-building and events. The answers to these questions reveal how much has changed in a few years. No sane business leader would adopt the 2019 default office model, one in which companies leased a lot of real estate and insisted people follow a strict, in-office regimen five days a week. Who would sacrifice flexibility, limit the talent pool and take on the cost that comes with the traditional office model. Today, organizations start with a very different default model. It�s one that lacks a lot of or any office space, that requires no or few in-office days, that sets no limits on where talent is sought, that establishes no rules about the hours when work should be done.

THE GOOD OLD DAYS\r\r\tNostalgia is remembering all of the good and none of the bad. Many people recall the office of yesteryear with great fondness. They talk about how it was more of a �family� atmosphere than today, the wonderful office parties, the way business was transacted with great efficiency, the big offices with beautiful views.

My 37 years there provides a personal history of office realities and how they evolved�both the good and the bad. Consider how business was conducted in the �80s:\rOffice Hours. In the 1980s everyone was expected to be sitting and working by 9am and no one could leave till 5pm. Lunch was one hour or less. Formal Dress Code. All the men wore suits with ties and the women wore dresses in the �80s. Hierarchy of office space. The more senior you were, the bigger the office (and it had a door. ). Middle management also had offices. Junior folks had cubicles. Secretaries and assistants worked in outside offices and passageways. We then moved to our own building which maximized the number of conference rooms and the cubicle walls moved even higher for more privacy and sound proofing. Technology. In the early �80s, the first word processors were introduced but pen and paper and typewriters reigned supreme�managers would write something longhand and the secretary would type it. Sometimes we�d present �acetates�, using an acetate projector and a screen. Intra-office communication was paper-based with mail delivery and mail pick up between offices three times a day. The telephone was the principal way we spoke with outside parties--voice mail had just been introduced",

Workstyle/Culture. Smoking was prevalent when I started at Burnett. Many senior managers had alcohol in their cabinets, and we had discussions around alcohol. There were few people of color outside of the secretaries and mail staff. Few women leaders existed. A pyramid organizational structure and military-style hierarchy created operational efficiency (though not necessarily widespread engagement and innovation). Though things have changed since the �80s, they didn�t change all that much until COVID. Until relatively recently, most offices were built around a rigid-system based on physical location, space hierarchies, the need for physical presence at all time and the inability to access what one needed for work from home. From the perspective of 2023, such as system seems archaic. In reality, it fit the zeitgeist. It helped get things done and provided people with a logical, orderly way to get work done and advance their careers. But the zeitgeist has changed, in large part because of technology.

Almost half of them were at different companies� headquarters, and a major reason I was invited there to speak was to bring back employees to offices for a few days.

Obviously, some industries will still require people to be in the office full time because of the type of work they do. The healthcare industry, for instance, isn�t going to change this requirement in the near future, since robot doctors and nurses are generally not acceptable substitutes for human beings (with the exception of some robotic surgeries). Similarly, people still want human waiters and waitresses when the go out to restaurants, and as far as I know, tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, etc. ) have not been replaced by AI. The Flex Index report provides two useful graphics that provide snapshots of industries that embrace work-time flexibility and those that resist it:\r\t\r\r\r\t�Type of work done in office. Not so long ago, we needed offices to get work done. They contained the �equipment��computers, printers, copiers, etc. �that were necessary to produce work outputs. Today, the vast majority of this equipment exists remotely. Nonetheless, the pre-COVID presumption was that specific work tasks require an office presence, including:\rResearch and Analytics: Looking up data and searching for supporting evidence. Analytics and other analysis. Creating Documents: Putting together presentations and documents for sharing. Sharing Information and Documents: Working with teams to share information and build programs together",

Pitching and Selling Clients: Sharing information and finding ways to sell clients. In recent years, however, many business leaders have shifted their mindset on this topic, recognizing that a lot of these tasks can be done outside of the office. They�ve learned that research, creation and sharing of documents often is easier outside of the office when concentration is key and the internet and other digital tools facilitate the process. Organizations have also discovered that while learning and development, creative ideas and brainstorming and relationship development require in-person interaction, this interaction doesn�t have to take place within corporate offices. They are much more open to arranging in-person meetings in other venues�restaurants, off-site work spaces, outdoor settings, conferences and so on. Increasingly, companies are going to use offices for key events and other activities that benefit from people being together physically and where the offices offer advantages (central location, an auditorium or other sizeable room that can accommodate a large number of people, special equipment such as a movie-size screen or state-of-the-art sound system). �Office design. Here is where one of my favorite sayings� �the future does not fit in the containers of the past��is literally relevant. The big corner offices for executives, the mid-sized offices for middle managers, the bullpen for clerical people�this design has become an anachronism. If people are only going to be the office for a few days each week and their in-office tasks are mainly collaboration, brainstorming and learning, then office re-design is essential",

Andressen Horowitz, the big venture capital firm, has moved from a Palo Alto HQ to basically stating that their HQ is in the cloud with five physical locations for people to meet. In a blog post Ben Horowitz stated: �In our firm�s new operating model, we work primarily virtually, but will use our physical presence to develop our culture, help entrepreneurs, and build relationships�As a result, we have configured the firm to be able to physically assemble anywhere in the world very quickly�� \r      To replace a single HQ office space, some companies are considering creating many offices closer to where talent, opportunity and clients are",

No more office hours. If COVID taught us nothing else about work, it was that one set of office hours doesn�t fit all employees. Some people are more productive at night, some early in the morning. Some are more effective if they take numerous breaks throughout a long work day while others excel when they can sustain their focus for hours. By accommodating different work time preferences, organizations maximize their people�s contributions. More than that, we are living in a global world where more and more work gets done asynchronously versus synchronously�it makes sense to keep the office open continuously to accommodate employees working in different countries (as well as functioning best at different times). In terms of the physical office, to maximize in-person interaction and learning, most offices are likely to be busiest between noon and evenings as people gather for meals or social events or around client/customer-related events. The hours will fit the work and the need--versus the work and the need fitting the hours. PREDICTING FUTURE OFFICE CHANGES\r\r\tWhile the previous office transformations have already started to manifest themselves, others are on the horizon. Though it�s impossible to know how soon the following with become reality�or how these changes may evolve�they all seem likely to further alter where and how we work:\r\r\t�Technology will blur the distinction between in-person and virtual meetings. As I write this, three major announcements have been made in the past 10 days from Apple and Google. Apple will be upgrading its Macintosh Operating system so that the presenter in a virtual presentation will be seen in front of their presentation�it will create the verisimilitude of an in-person speaker as opposed to seeing a slide with a disembodied voice",

While the Apple Mac upgrade is free, the other breakthroughs cost many thousands of dollars�no doubt, the price will come down considerably within five years as competition heats up in this category and product usage increases. These innovations combined with other advances will diminish the awkwardness and remote qualities of virtual meetings, making them less of an alternative to in-person meetings and more standard operating procedure. �Significant build-out in physical infrastructure and services to support hybrid work. As companies move toward a mix of virtual and in-person work, they will need to create office environments and services that support this mix. This mix will vary from company to company. Some may have people in the office two or three days each week, while others will favor a much more virtual structure�two or three days in the office annually, and each of these days will be built around events. Whatever the mix might be, offices will be redesigned to accommodate the virtual/in-person policy. There will be fewer private offices, and some will eliminate them. Organizations will also create more collaborate spaces, attempting to generate synergies between people working in the office and those working outside of it.

This will happen for two reasons. First, people will continue to form habits around the new office normal of flexible hours, remote work and reconfigured spaces. As these new habits form and become ingrained, people will let go of traditional ideas about offices and explore new concepts. Second, as research on emerging ways of working is published and discussed, it will validate our instinctive sense of how offices should change.

CUSTOMIZING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS\r\tOffices are going to evolve based on their distinctive elements. One size never fits all. It will be up to companies to personalize and customize the right combination of in-person and remote work for their employees just as many companies wish to personalize and customize services and products for their customers. A startup Silicon Valley tech company is going to create settings and policies that are significantly different than a family-run textile company in the Midwest. While they may share similar features�perhaps they�ll both adopt a flexible work policy�their physical space and specific programs will reflect five factors: the industry; geography; tenure of individual; type of job being done; industry talent dynamics. Let�s look at these factors and how they�ll shape offices in different ways. �Industry type. This is the obvious differentiator: most people can�t work remotely in areas such as construction, medicine and retail. You can�t be an iron worker balancing on a beam thousands of feet in the air remotely (at least, not as of this writing). A very senior and accomplished software engineer who has no direct reports, on the other hand, may go to a physical office infrequently. They can do their work, test their code, access all they need and collaborate with other people using modern cloud-based computing and communication technology. �Geography. Cultures and infrastructures vary by country. In China (and some other Asian countries) homes often lack sufficient space to work there. Consequently, the centralized office space in China is likely to be more dominant (for other reasons as well)",

When someone joins a company, a certain amount of onboarding is required to acculturate and train them. This is best done through in-person interaction whether it is in the office or some other location. Some new hires must be present for skill acquisition involving communication, presentation and leading meetings. Without in-person interaction and observation, it�s difficult to master these skills. Veteran employees who are familiar with their organizations may require less time physically with colleagues but even this can vary depending on their role. A senior leader may need to be in the office for a combination of guidance and presence. For this reason, it�s best to avoid ironclad rules about office presence and adjust according to individual circumstance�roles and tenure should be weighed before making a decision about how much time a given individual should spend in the office. �Type of job. A taxi driver needs to be on the road, but a taxi dispatcher can work from home. A software engineer at a technology firm can work primarily from home remotely but a head of sales needs to be present in order to train and motivate the sales teams and be in-person with clients. A barista at Starbucks needs to be at the store every day but a marketer at Starbucks does not need to be in the office every day. �Talent dynamics. In many industries, talent is in short supply in a market or across their industries. The demand for AI engineers and data-scientists exceeds the supply today, as an example. To access and compete for talent when demand exceeds the supply, companies must adopt office policies that can be adapted to talent�s requirements�this is necessary to attract and keep these highly skilled individuals, wherever they are located and however they prefer to work",

There are, however, specific principles or guiding ideas that can help leaders construct the offices that best suit their companies and cultures. First, they adopt a future-forward attitude. They resist the tug of the past�s tide, refusing to dwell on what was and return to halcyon days of yore. Instead, they are open to new ideas about office policies and environments, and they�re willing to experiment with fresh approaches. Second, they are open to new and innovative office concepts. They don�t get locked into a rigid office structure or system. By building agility into their office, they can balance in-person and remote work, veteran and new talent, preferences for working the traditional day versus working �off� hours. This open-minded approach is absolutely necessary in the world of unbundled and distributed work. Third, they value in-person interaction. Though it�s technologically possible to run certain businesses entirely virtually, it�s not humanly feasible. The most forward-looking companies make sure they maintain some level of in-person work, capitalizing on the innovation produced when people are physically present as well as the relationships that are built and strengthened through personal interactions. Fourth, they design systems and procedures for synergy. Put simply, this means that they must aim for the right balance of in-person and virtual�that if they get this balance right, the sum will be greater than the parts. Flexibility, iterating from beta and constant learning help produce synergy. Fifth, future-focused companies recognize the value of events. These events can revolve around training workshops, brainstorming sessions and celebrations. They provide motivating reasons for people to return to the office.

Sixth, and perhaps most important, the visionary business leaders are providing their people with freedom within a framework. They set general parameters for work�perhaps two days of in-office work weekly�but they also allow justified variations. Some teams may want and need to meet with their members more than the required two days per week, while others are more productive when they convene only one day per week. With these principles in mind, let�s look at some companies that are putting them into practice. Boston-based ad agency A&G has taken inspiration from Ray Oldenburg�s books�The Great Good Place�and�Celebrating the Third Place, where the author described the concept of Third Spaces as �public places that host the regular, voluntary, informal, and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals beyond the realms of home and work. ��\r      A&G recognized that an artificial barrier separated workplaces and homes, and after COVID, they realized that either/or was the past and both/and was the future.

Some startups are deciding that the purpose of an office is really to socialize, and they�re allowing employees to work from anywhere, and then picking a place for people to meet occasionally throughout the year to get to know each other. A workflow automation business, Zapier, has company retreats where it invites all workers to spend a few days in-person with their colleagues; the company pays for flights, accommodation, and food, and organizes ways for people in different departments to get to know each other. Gitlab, which Choudhury says is one of the world�s largest remote companies with 1,300 employees, allows their people to be fully remote but has at least one offsite meetup around the world each year.

A never-ending stream of praise sometimes make successful leaders feel invincible and invites pompous behavior. Howard Schultz of Starbucks is a brilliant operator and visionary who seems not to have fully comprehended the challenges faced by his store staff. Due to a complex menu, multiple ways customers were ordering coffee (especially pre-orders via mobile apps) and new expectations of a younger demographic, many staff members became increasingly disgruntled. As a result, they unionized at some stores and pushed for higher wages and a more manageable workload. Despite being a forward-thinking leader who provided his people with generous educational and health care benefits, Howard Schulz reacted negatively to these unionizing efforts. Because of the way he reacted, Howard Schultz has been portrayed as anti-union and out of touch with his people�ironic, since he built his company and reputation as being pro-talent. Fortunately, Schultz seems to have got the message and replaced himself as CEO with Laxman Narasimhan who is known to be a highly strategic but humble and people-oriented leader. Laxman spent his first months at Starbucks working with baristas all over the world and still shows up in the stores to work. The new leadership lessons take time to learn. I know this from personal experience. From 1996 to 2003, I launched three digital marketing companies under the Leo Burnett brand. At the first of them, Giant Step, my partners Adam and Eric Heneghan wanted to know why I deferred constantly to Leo Burnett senior management; they also couldn�t understand why I analyzed every decision in deep detail. Over time, they taught me a new way of managing and leading; that in most cases, moving forward fast and iterating with agility in the real marketplace was a better strategy than hand-wringing micromanagement and getting things perfect",

Adam and Eric taught me that in this new digital world, such an approach was an anachronism; that the experience of our senior management wasn�t relevant to the demands of our digital marketplace or our small but fast-growing status. As a leader, I discovered the benefit of adopting a learner�s mindset. To this day, I bring in best-in-class teachers to help me learn about whatever is relevant, from AI to supply chains to emerging global markets. I recognize I have been fortunate to work for companies that indulged my passion for learning and encouraged adapting my management and leadership approach. I was also lucky that the pace of change was slower back in the early part of the 21st century, affording me more time to learn. Today, leaders need to learn on the fly. The hurdles today are more difficult. In fact, the bar hasn�t just been raised for leadership; it�s been widened. Any organization interviewing for leadership positions should keep these three words in mind: Grow. Communicate. Operate. If they can�t do all three, they can�t do the job. MANAGER METAMORPHOSIS\r\r\tAs I�ve noted, leadership isn�t a position, and every manager has the opportunity to display the leadership qualities just enumerated. On the other hand, people who are high-level leaders�CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, CMOs and so on�often are removed from the managerial fray. They don�t spend a lot of time on the nitty-gritty tasks of management, engaging in strategic decision-making, policy-making and other conceptual and corporate-wide responsibilities. Even though many organizations are reducing the number of managers they employ as well as management levels, this role is still crucial for organizations to function effectively. More to the point, though, it�s a role that�s changing radically",

But that�s what managers shouldn�t be. What should they be instead. For the answer, let�s start with talent and human resources expert Josh Bersin, who I interviewed on my�What Next. �podcast. Josh launched Bersin & Associates in 2001, an advisory firm focused on corporate learning which expanded and grew and was bought by Deloitte in 2012. Josh spent 6 years at Deloitte. After leaving Deloitte, he started the Josh Bersin Company which helps guide organizations through transformations. Josh is attuned to recent changes that have affected organizations, and his belief is that a new type of manager is needed to help people adapt to this evolving environment. For instance, in a world where teams are increasingly dominant, improvisation and agility take precedence over hierarchy and bureaucracy. Today, teams need to be coached; in the past, individuals needed to be directed. The traditional manager�s emphasis on measurement, too, can have negative consequences these days. It can reduce productivity when people focus myopically on reaching a goal versus doing the right thing�at Wells Fargo, employees opened fake accounts since they were compensated based on the number of accounts they opened. General Electric, too, was so results oriented that the short-term was emphasized over the long term. Managers must learn to encourage their people to do what is best for the team, group or organization rather than fixate on making their numbers. I can�t overemphasize this point: Managers should be coaches, not bosses. Few companies have retained the military model, where bosses were feared, where they drove their people relentlessly to meet deadlines, increase production and so on. In an unbundled, distributed world of work, we need managers who can inspire and teach, not managers who can bark orders",

This holistic view is crucial for managers to understand and work within. Rather than telling people �the rules� and expecting them to obey (9 to 5 office hours, no personal computer use at one�s desk, etc. ), managers should emphasize cultural components�well-being, inclusion, recognition/reward and flexibility (optionality, agency and freedom). By communicating these cultural factors, managers can give their people much looser and more relevant parameters for work behaviors. When these parameters are conveyed effectively, they influence people wherever they are, not just within the physical office space. SIX WAYS TO BE A BETTER MANAGER\r\r\tNow and in the coming years, there�s going to be a lot of discussion about people refusing to return to the workplace. This is a sexy topic, but it obscures a much more important one: the ability of managers to adapt and grow amid evolving realities. Here�s what the new world of work requires of managers:\r\r\t�Nuance and personalization. Some managers used to say, �I treat everyone equally. �  In an era where individuality is prized more than ever before, such an egalitarian position is out of step with the times. Specifically, managers should understand that: \r\r--Some jobs require more in-person interaction and others require less. --Junior or new employees might require more in-person presence both for training and adapting to cultures. --Every employee has a life outside of work whether it is family or health or other challenges; in most instances, they should be addressed rather than ignored. --Employees will need to constantly adapt and upgrade their skills and work in new ways; they require managerial support systems that allow the individual and teams to grow. �Encouraging employees to signal when they need help",

Encouraging people to let managers know when they�re struggling or uncertain is a good managerial strategy�far better than communicating (explicitly or implicitly) that they don�t want to hear bad news. Employees need to see managers as allies to solve problems rather than disciplinarians from whom they need to hide problems. To achieve this objective, managers must be approachable and accessible, minimizing the number of gatekeepers and processes that stand in the way of getting help. �Constant communication so people are informed and updated. In the old managerial era, information was power, hoarding of data made someone valuable and information asymmetry was a way of doing business. Now and in the coming years, this is a recipe for disaster. Given that people are working all over the place and at different times, continuous, open communication is the only thing that will keep people on the same page. Unfortunately, the managerial reflex to hoard information is powerful, instilled over decades. As a cautionary lesson, therefore, consider what happens when managers aren�t communicating constantly and honestly: \r\r      --Bad Morale: People will assume the worst (company is doing badly, they are not important, somebody is mad at them). --Bad Decisions: They will make decisions on faulty and out of date information or poor guidance since they need to move quickly. --Bad Direction: They will look to peers or less informed people for direction when stuck. �Investing more time in creating, building, coaching, or servicing versus monitoring, delegating, allocating and updating",

Spend more time on doing rather than delegating, on driving outcomes rather than managing processes. When I was a new leader in the digital space, I arrived as an operator�someone who had been taught to do and decide. I realized, however, that the people I was hiring were far more skilled at doing in the digital arena than I was. I transitioned to a leader who mentored and coached people about strategy, setbacks and clients, a far more appropriate role than trying to implement everything from the top down. �Become better at giving feedback. Typically, managers give feedback infrequently or formally (performance reviews). At a time when people often don�t see managers (in person) for days or longer and change is fast and furious, people need regular input about how they�re doing. There often isn�t the time or opportunity to chat informally in the break room or at lunch about a project. Therefore, managers must take on the responsibility of becoming better feedback providers. To that end, here are some suggestions:\r      --Focus on how the task or the process could have been improved rather than criticize the person. By focusing on how an assignment could be done better, the emphasis is in on the product and not the person. --Deliver negative  (when performance comes up short) by comparing it to a higher standard, especially something the individual achieved on an earlier project. Recalling assignments or times where the individual or team did a great job reinforces the message that the person can do better rather than suggesting he�s incapable of doing a good job. --Be sensitive and aware of extenuating circumstances. �We all have bad days and many times these are a result of something else distracting us or worrying us in our lives.

The more important half is showing or teaching or guiding on how one can improve. --Identify the next opportunity or project for a do-over. Identifying an upcoming opportunity to put the feedback to work concentrates the mind and channels emotions to action. --Provide personal help and perspective. Asking how you can help reinforces that you are on the person�s side and are committed to them. Offering context�communicating what others have struggled with over the years or what you may have grappled with--lets people know that mistakes and less-than-stellar performance are par for the course in career growth. In the past, managers gave their people feedback, but they often weren�t good at it. It was too harsh or generalized or sugar-coated. Now and in the future, managers need to master the art, and the previous six suggestions are a good start to gaining mastery. RENNOVATING STRUCTURES\r\r\tWhile leaders and managers need to exhibit new behaviors in a changing workplace, larger organizational issues exist that affect these behaviors. Structures and policies can facilitate future-looking behaviors and discourage ones mired in the past. We need to change organizational incentive systems to encourage actions that are productive in 2024 and beyond rather than cling to ones optimized for the past. If we want managers to coach rather than control, for instance, than we need to incentivize the former behaviors. Management that thrives in the future will bend structures and processes, adapting to change. Conversely, marketplaces will not not bend to fit yesterday�s shapes and business models. Therefore, we need to be proactive in our structural responses to the new world of work",

One of the major challenges for leaders and managers is keeping the business running effectively today while also reshaping it for the future. It�s difficult to implement exciting new AI technologies company-wide when it will cause chaos in current daily operations as training ramps up. A solution to this quandary is developing a team to optimize for tomorrow with its own specific goals and incentives while focusing the rest of the organization on maximizing today (with their own goals and incentives). Both groups report to the same management and are aware of each other�s goals and can swap talent and resources as necessary but need to focus on their specific objectives. This ensures that a company optimizes both for today and tomorrow. It also recognizes that tomorrow�s competitors may be different from today and to win against them a company may need new type of talent, measurement criteria and investments. When I helped launched Starcom IP, we used this split personality approach effectively. The two units of the company�online media planning and traditional media planning�each operated with its own policies, pricing and experts. �Develop an open partnering ecosystem. Throughout this book, I�ve emphasized the importance of changing in response to or even in anticipation of new developments in technology, business and society. It is no longer possible for leaders and managers to do a good job without access to a wide range of outside partners. As the world changes�as new processes develop, as new markets emerge, as new products are introduced�organizations need to develop relationships with experts in these unfamiliar areas. No individual is an island and no company in a connected world can prosper without great connections to other individuals or companies whether they be suppliers, partners, sources of talent, technology, and other platforms",

All smart managers are asking if we are investing enough in upgrading and resourcing talent. Are we ensuring tight co-ordination with our partners and suppliers. Are our external resources constantly iterating and improving to help give ourselves and our companies an edge. �Play jazz, not classical. These two musical styles provide a good metaphor for organization changes in structure, policy and culture. Consider that classical music often involves an orchestra led by a conductor; the orchestra members must play a piece exactly as composed (with small variations for speed and volume), and a hierarchy (i. e. first chair, second chair, etc. ) executes the commands of the conductor. In jazz, ensembles sometimes have a leader but even then not much hierarchy exists and different players take turns with the lead. They are encouraged to improvise and interpret passages their own way�they have the freedom to iterate and invent on the fly as the spirit, the situation, and their fellow players move them. And finally, classical emphasizes the collective group while jazz puts the spotlight on the individual. Organizations need to transition from classical to jazz structures. In my online newsletter, I�ve written about the �four shifts��technology, power, boundary and mind�and how everything from AI to globalization to remote work to younger generational attitudes about work have made the old structures outmoded. More specifically, size matters less today as technology provides small companies and individuals with access to cutting edge quality, manufacturing scale and global marketplaces",

SECTION III: PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK\r\r\rChapter 10�RE-IMAGINE THE COMPANY WITH PARADIGM SHIFTS IN MIND\r\r\tFor many years, large organizations remained remarkably consistent in their strategies and processes�and remarkably profitable. Even in the latter part of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st, blue chip, long-established companies such as IBM, General Motors and Procter & Gamble adhered to their traditional business plans. Even though they gave lip service to change, their product offerings, services, employee policies and organizational structures didn�t change significantly. If it ain�t broke, why fix it. To tell a successful company with years of consistent accomplishment that they must re-imagine themselves would seem nonsensical�at least back then. Today, however, it makes all the sense in the world. THE NEED TO LOOK FORWARD, NOT BACKWARD\r\r\tAs earlier chapters have emphasized, there is no going back. Though many organizational leaders recognize this truth, they don�t always embrace the corollary: The need to assess and prepare for the future. As daunting as this exercise might be, it�s necessary. Organizations need to do more than commit to change; they have to anticipate what changes are best for them in the future",

What will people need and expect. How will demographics, technology and other global shifts create new competitors or recharge current competitors and how will categories blur, blend and maybe even disappear. Amidst these new expectations and changing competitive dynamics, what advantage will your company offer. A differentiated or better product. A competitive moat of network effects, scale or some other dynamic. A better experience. Speed and value. If this sounds as if I�m suggesting you create a future business strategy, that�s exactly what I�m suggesting. Very few companies get strategy right primarily because they do not understand the exponential impact of technology; and because they define their category and competitive set looking backward rather than forward. If you think I�m being hyperbolic when I state that organizations are bad at strategy, let me share a few cautionary tales. Nokia and Blackberry dominated mobile phones but were obsessed with hardware and when Apple introduced the iPhone (which had no physical keys and worked using software) both companies refused to adapt before it was too late. Kodak invented digital imaging but did not move forward with it because its management was incented to sell chemicals and photographic paper�unnecessary elements for digital imagery. A few years later, a young company called Instagram with 15 employees was more valuable than Kodak. Most of the major automobile manufacturers defined the key drivers of their category in ways that did not envision Tesla or an Uber as a threat until they began to scale. They couldn�t see how software might be more important than hardware. Or how electric might be better than internal combustion engines. Or how a significant number of people might prefer on-demand mobility to the expense of owning cars. These examples all represent failures of strategic imagination",

Walmart revitalized itself in eCommerce by buying Jet. Com and Flipkart, entered the advertising business through Walmart Connect and committed to sustainability and paying its workers better; once again they�re doing well and a significant competitor to Amazon. McDonald�s veered away from its standard strategy, introducing all-day breakfasts, investing deeply in its Mobile App and re-configuring its drive-through service; today, 75% of its business is through these channels.

In the past five years things have become far more complicated. More moving parts exist, buzzing around at faster speeds in ways that are more interconnected to each other. Many of the assumptions that underpinned strategy have not only shifted but, in some ways, the exact opposite of what firms believed is coming true. Think about some of the beliefs in the past on which organizations based their strategies:\r\r\t�Populations are expanding. When calculating �total addressable market� or �rate of growth� most companies factored in growing populations. Now, populations have started to decline in most advanced economies at a frightening rate. �Scale is a competitive advantage. While scale still matters, it matters far less than ever before (except for a few types of business) and the very nature of what constitutes scale is changing; many old forms of scale are now competitive disadvantages. �Capital and talent are in abundant supply. Capital is still abundant (though more selective), but talent is so scarce that the greatest ROI for businesses may come from unleashing the untapped capacity of their talent. �Return on Human Capital�will be a key measure of return joining Return on Capital and other metrics. Now let�s look at these three outmoded beliefs in a bit more detail and see how updated beliefs can and should affect strategy.

The Great Shrinkage has begun. Given these numbers, every business should ask two questions of their strategy:  \r      How will our plans be impacted in our key markets with declining populations. What is our plan for the continent of Africa which will contain more 40 percent of the global population in 2100. In terms of scale, every leader knows that in the past, scale has provided companies with many benefits from higher margins due to lower costs, to insulation from competition due to moats of marketing spending and widespread distribution. During the last ten years, however, the benefits of scale have diminished and in some cases are proving to be a disadvantage. With direct-to-consumer marketing enabled by the Internet and platforms like Shopify, widespread retail distribution is no longer as effective an advantage as it once was. Distribution scale matters, of course, but there are ways to route around the big stores by going direct and creating demand that forces buyers to stock your product. Similarly, communication scale has changed. Search and social are leading to communication channels where spending power is no longer a competitive edge (as it was in television or print where marketers cornered key inventory at advantageous prices). Platforms like Facebook enable millions of small businesses with personalization and targeting capabilities to discover customers and be discovered. Manufacturing scale is one of the most obvious areas where everything has changed. Platforms from Amazon Web Services to Foxconn allow smaller companies to gain the edges of scaled manufacturing, distribution, and technology without any of the legacy disadvantages of size.

In the post-COVID world of unbundled workplaces, more ways exist to build teams both globally and in real time.

Speaking of talent, it�s become scarce rather than abundant. Companies need to pay attention to talent for strategies to work in the future. As I�ve noted, populations are shrinking and aging, so from a pure numerical standpoint, talent is in shorter supply. Perhaps less obviously, many employees have moved hundreds of miles from their offices during COVID. Others have side-gigs or have begun portfolio careers working for a spectrum of global companies facilitated by good internet connections. As a result, growing, leading, attracting, retaining, and investing in this changing pool of talent is going to be a key strategic advantage. Every strategy deck should have a significant section on unleashing talent rather become fixated only on competitive dynamics, financial metrics and total addressable market and other data. Companies grow when talent grows. If you are skeptical of this statement, try this experiment: The next time a well-known CEO is fired, find out the real reason for this action.

Certain companies provide us with models for reinvention, including Domino�s Pizza in the food category, Walmart in retail, Nike in apparel and Microsoft in software. These and other reinventing companies share the following:  \r\r   �External and Market Focus. A realistic understanding that the future would be different and that what got the company to success would not necessarily keep the company succeeding. �Internal Changes. Recognition that to win in the future they would need to re-think their culture, their talent, their business model and the way to go to market. �New Partnerships. A willingness to partner with others including erstwhile competitors. Understandably, perhaps, some leaders are reluctant to embrace this reinvention mentality. They ignore or rationalize the changes that are coming. Some hope that they�ll retire before the changes happen. Others convince themselves that change will not impact the company. And there are those who create excuses (�it�s too expensive�, �now is not the right time�, etc. ) to maintain the status quo. Consider what the reinventors did. Domino�s realized its pizza was seen as �lower quality� than some competitors and that in a world of the Internet and Mobile phones it was behind in e-commerce. Walmart grasped that customer behavior had changed and that Amazon rather than Kroger was the key threat and it would require a significant amount of investments to catch up. Nike determined that it needed to leverage new demographics, the power of community and the ability to sell directly to re-invent themselves. Microsoft acted after deciding that a focus on the PC, on refusing to partner and a corrosive internal culture needed to be upended. Today all four of these companies are category leaders with market capitalization and momentum like never before. They changed their own paradigm before the paradigm of change could make them irrelevant",

In fact, the four main trends that will shape the future are entirely predictable. Here they are:\r\r\t�Multi-polar globalization. Globalization is unstoppable (many of the big challenges are global--climate change, COVID-19, China, supply chain congestion). �Some recent articles have suggested that globalization is diminishing, but that�s not what I and others observe. While globalization faces challenges, the real news is that it�s morphing into something new. In the past, the U. S. and Europe dominated this trend, but now and in the future, the centers of influence are more diverse, including China and India. For instance, strategic imperatives to ensure a steady supply of silicon chips and rare earths will impact most businesses directly and indirectly. �Demographic shifts. As I�ve discussed earlier, declining population, aging populations�and significant differences in ethnic make-up and mindsets�between young and old�will challenge business leaders (not to mention politicians). In the U. S. , 10,000 people turn 65 every day and despite the fixation of marketers on the young, people over 50 have the money. In the U. S. next year, the country will have a multi-ethnic majority under 18 years old while those over 50 are dominantly Caucasian. In the past, the big differences were in ethnic make-up. Today and in the future, older white perspectives on social and economic issues are quite different than the view of younger, ethic folks. And this generational gap is widespread across the world. �The Third Connected Age.

In an alliterative nutshell, this is what happens:  \r      A cavalcade of consultants convey and communicate to the C-Suite with countless charts and choices. A flurry of futurists frame, focus, and filter the way forward with the finesse of fortune tellers.

Here�s a shocking truth: No strategy will work unless management implements a corresponding plan to grow and change the people in the organization. Though I discussed the challenge of talent scarcity earlier, the point here is to maximize the talent you possess. Think about all the changes discussed here and in previous chapters�everything from population shifts to technology breakthroughs to globalization. All of this is going to affect how people think and feel about work. You can have the most brilliant consultants working for you and a strategic plan that is incredibly innovative and far-reaching, but if you fail to help employees change with the changing organization, the strategy won�t work. Because while businesses are a collection of ideas, technologies, patents, brands, ecosystems and people, it is people who are the key since they create the ideas, technologies, patents, brands and eco-systems. Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson said, �Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face�. The reaction of people to changes in systems, policies, processes and structures can be a punch in the strategist�s face. When a strategy is implemented with much fanfare and expense, business leaders must be attuned to how this strategy�especially if it�s attempting to reinvent the company�affects people. Telling people that change is good, threatening them with job loss if they do not change or creating communication materials and slogans to convince them to embrace the strategy rarely works in the short run. Even more distressing, it will likely fail in the long run after the threat of punishment for failing to embrace it fades.

For a reinvention strategy to be leveraged in ways that transform an organization, company leaders should keep the following in mind: The only true transformation happens when the mindsets and behaviors of the people working for the business transform. To that end, here are three questions that all managers and leaders should ask their teams to ensure they�re aligned with the new strategy:\r1)�� How do you expect our customers/consumers/members needs and expectations to change in the future. 2)�� What are our key strengths and weaknesses in meeting and aligning with these shifts. 3)�� If we had no constraints except we had to ensure that what we did was legal�and that it was technologically possible and we�d break even financially in 3 years or less�what products and services would we design. This exercise makes people look up from their day to day tasks and understand risks and opportunities; it raises their consciousness about the need to do things differently. It also motivates them to activate the strategy in their areas of competence and expertise. At the same time, management must offer three clear answers around the organizational reinvention, providing information and motivation that works synergistically with employee answers to the previous three questions. Specifically:\r1)���Why are the recommended changes good for our people�s�personal career growth. 2)���What are the monetary or other�incentives�to change. 3)���When and where will�training�be provided to help our people learn the new skills needed.

Can�t we just muddle through change as we�ve done in the past. No, and here are two simple reasons why:\r\tTalent is asking their managers: What do you do. Management is asking their talent to work harder, show up and grow up. Both are legitimate responses to the current work environment, and they suggest how ill-prepared we are for our changing world. The good news is that we�re fully capable of implementing the retraining I�m advocating. As you�ll discover, it doesn�t require an investment in the training protocols of the past, but a commitment to the training paradigms of the future. TRAINING INNOVATIONS\r\r\tOrganizations may not call what they�re doing �retraining�, but a number of companies have made dramatic shifts from the training protocols of the past. Bank of America, for instance, established �The Academy� in 2016, is an ambitious reimagining of the scope and depth of training. Consisting of 97 programs, it includes a startling variety of content and goals�peer mentoring, immersion programs, high tech learning. The Academy is designed to provide support and connection as people grow in their careers. But what�s most significant is that it�s the type of training that acknowledges the sea change that has occurred in recent years. Rather than focusing on training that benefits the organization, it emphasizes an approach that benefits employees (as well as the organization). It understands that tenure and retention of employees is crucial when people matter more than ever before and the power has shifted toward talent. Microsoft, too, has implemented an ambitious continuous training program that is quite different from the limited, one-and-done classes of the past. Its emphasis on continuous education alone recognizes that in a world where change is constant and significant, one class no longer suffices",

It integrates learning experiences into an employee�s work flow and personalizes these experiences. It helps employees tailor their training, allowing them to learn what they need to know for their jobs, their careers and their growth. Viva takes into account a given employee�s location (office or remote), goals and previous experiences and knowledge. Other organizations are launching training innovations in more targeted ways, but they represent a recognition that people need to learn new things in new ways. A Boston Consulting Group study (June 8, 2022) offers a number of examples of how this is so. The study notes that companies like Amazon and Goldman Sachs are offering �returnship� programs for organizational alumni who want to come back to work�as part of these programs, returning employees are offered training to help them transition to the new world of work. What�s most significant, though, aren�t the specific programs but the growing sense among organizational leaders that they and their people need to alter their perspectives and upgrade their knowledge and skills to deal effectively with a marketplace and larger world where nothing stays the same for long. THE BIG QUESTION\r\r\tAs I travel around the world speaking and working with a wide range of companies, their most common question is: �How do we remain relevant in transformative times. � Not just relevant as organizations grappling with new business models and competitive landscapes but as individual talent and leaders facing a future that seems to be shape-shifting constantly.

As I�ve discussed and as the media is increasingly fond of pointing out, a growing percentage of workers will be remote. This division between remote and office work is overly simplistic. In reality, we�ll have many variations on the in-office and remote theme, with companies seeking a mix that works best for them. On top of that, organizations will be using more freelance talent that works elsewhere, and they�ll need to integrate these �outside� people as well. Though a huge amount of attention has been devoted to the remote work trend, relatively little focus has been directed at training people to work effectively in this evolving environment. Thus, successful companies will train their people to manage and communicate across different models of work. �Who. We need to retrain ourselves to lead a much more diverse employee population than in the past. Traditional policies and practices were created in an era when most companies were run by white males and, consciously or not, these policies and practices reflected this homogeneity. Consider that in the under-21-years-of-age population, Caucasians are now a minority in the U. S. Add to that the growing number of women with college degrees and employed by organizations, the changes in sexual preference (13% of the population are gay, trans, etc. ) and the aging of the population and the workforce. We need to learn how to attract, retain and motivate a much more diverse group than in the past. �What. More specifically, we need to educate ourselves about what a job should be�what tasks and responsibilities are best for a given job.

COMPELLING REASONS TO THINK AND LEARN DIFFERENTLY\r\tTypical corporate training was tailored for a time when changes came slowly if at all, when employees worked in-office and when core competencies were evergreen. Now, we need to transition toward a just-in-time, self-serve skills acquisition operation. As a given company and the competitive landscape changes, people need to obtain the emerging knowledge and skills that will help them function effectively in this environment. As most of you probably know, training in the business world used to consist of some initial onboarding lasting a few days to a few months, during which HR people familiarized new employees with the company�s culture, technology and tools and processes. Additional training ranged from periodic mandatory training on issues such as data privacy and policy and diversity, equity and inclusion training; the company might also help underwrite an evening course or executive program at a university to bolster specific skills and knowledge. Expertise was either purchased by hiring college graduates or experienced employees from other companies. Training programs were limited and generalized because:\r   --A surplus of skilled labor existed. It was cheaper to buy from outside than train inside. --The rate of change in an industry was slow to medium paced. There was no urgency to acquire/train for new expertise",

In this environment, companies must focus on providing labor with the skills they need to do a good job and the compensation to keep them in place. --A sudden shift in workforce mindsets. Covid-19 and Hybrid-Remote work changed what people thought of work and how it fit into their life and how and where they could work.

In addition, leaders and managers need to take responsibility for fostering a shift in philosophy and strategy. They must retrain themselves and others so that they learn to think differently about the business. Retraining can take many forms, from one-on-one discussions to policy shifts. My former company, Publicis Groupe, now keeps people up to speed by giving all their 100,000 employees access to training courses both on demand and in real time (and on any device) covering hundreds of topics. A series of certifications (in various skill areas) enable people to apply for new jobs or rise to the next level. They also have made a $100 million investment that ensures every employee will be trained in AI. The idea behind these types of investments isn�t just to help employees obtain better jobs but to enhance their ability to grow themselves�to give them tools to so they can reach their goals. For this reason, many of Publicis� training tools are aimed at helping people learn to work from anywhere in the world and gain global perspectives. Because of the following epiphany, many companies are starting to realize that retraining the workforce is a necessity rather than an option: An organization�s growth and relevance in a changing world is directly proportional to employees� skill growth and relevance.

Until the early 21st century, little changed. While the technology advanced a bit and more diversity existed, we still valued stable careers, God-like management, putting in your time and being a good soldier. The social contract of mutual loyalty between employee and company was honored for the most part. It wasn�t until 2010 that the workplace began to shift in major ways due to a combination of financial challenges (The Great Recession of 2008/2009), the birth of smart phones and social media ( 2007) and other factors.

You may feel like resisting AI or any other new technology as a passing fad or as ill-suited to a given organizational task. The reflexive skepticism about anything new or different needs to be rejected in favor being open-minded and eager to embrace. Bear with me as I make my case. It�s 1977 and a new movie, Star Wars: A New Hope,�is released and in it a General Dodonna ends a briefing to his fighters (which includes Luke Skywalker) with the words��May the Force Be With You�. �\t\r      It's 1599 and somewhere in England a play by William Shakespeare is staged during which the following lines are spoken: �\r\"We at the height are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men\rWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\rOmitted, all the voyage of their life\rIs bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat,\rAnd we must take the current when it serves,\rOr lose our ventures",

The retraining focus here is on products and services�figuring out what changes are essential based on AI technologies. In many organizations, a �if it ain�t broke, don�t fix it� attitude prevails toward profitable products and services. Because of AI, everything must be rethought. This process isn�t as simple as using AI to automate and accelerate or to restructure in order to cut costs. Taking this simplistic approach will probably lead to more problems than solutions. There�s the story of an attorney who used AI to facilitate his work on a legal case only to find that AI had made things up. The opportunity with AI is a deep re-architecting of the business, and this requires answering three questions:\r      --What should be AI-enhanced and what should not. --How will the AI product be built/trained and what quality control will ensure that the result is safe and legal (among other things)",

Given all this, one aspect of retraining may involve communicating that size becomes less of a competitive advantage than in the past. It will also mean that senior management can no longer tell themselves that there�s no rush to embrace AI�that they can wait until retirement and pass the issue on to their successors. AI is scaling so quickly that even the most myopic leaders can see the writing on the wall. And it means that to adapt effectively, learning how to attract and retain talent that grasps how to work in AI-complimentary ways is crucial. Complement. As we become more and more reliant on technologies such as AI, we also need to balance or complement this reliance with distinctly human qualities. Pursuing this complementary strategy as part of a retraining approach will create synergies between people and machines. Chapter 12�REDESIGN THE STRUCTURES\r\r\tThere�s a reason we no longer live in mud huts or travel in horse-drawn carriages. Times change, technology improves and people�s needs and preferences shift. As much as we may love the simplicity of our old dwellings and the convenience of traditional transportation modes, we recognize the need to upgrade. But what if the need to upgrade isn�t as obvious as choosing a car over a horse-drawn carriage. Organizational structures have been in place so long that it�s sometimes difficult to recognize that they�re outmoded. For many years, businesses were hierarchies, run with military-like methods",

This justification is no longer valid. The balance of power is trending away from organizations and management and toward talent and individuals. Generational shifts, post-COVID mindsets, technology advances, new ways of working and recently-emerged marketplaces provide more options for people to connect, create and cultivate alternatives to where, when and how they work. In this environment, few people want to work for a company with policies and processes rooted in the �50s. Instead, they want a redesigned organizational structure, one that is far more flexible, equitable and innovative than past structures. MORE THAN REPLACING THE HEIRARCHY WITH TEAMS\r\r\tFor years, business pundits have talked about reinventing the corporation. About flattening it. About relying more on teams. About eliminating the bureaucracy. But that�s not what I�m talking about. Simplistic, one-size-fits-all restructuring plans don�t work, no matter how well-intentioned they might be. If you ask leaders to explain their organizations, they reflexively reach for organization charts. Whether a top-down hierarchy or a matrix structure or some combination of both, these aren�t so different from the first organizational charts developed in 1854 to help run the New York and Erie Railroad. These �fixed� structures no longer make sense, given that: talent today often seeks autonomy that runs counter to most locked-in processes and policies; the fluid eco-system of global partners and dynamic marketplaces has replaced many vertically integrated structures; modern connectivity places a premium on speed and agility (impossible to achieve in even semi-bureaucratic environments); and new technologies like AI are rendering traditional practices and ways of working obsolete",

All are valid responses to situations, but they also tend to be of limited value. That�s because they don�t focus on outcomes, customer needs or achieving sufficient flexibility to accommodate a range of managerial styles. That�s why so many companies go back and forth between centralized and decentralized models. They respond situationally. They centralize when costs must be constrained, decentralize when they�re accused of being slow and inflexible. They centralize again when a legal problem or process breakdown requires more control. And they may centralize or decentralize when a new CEO is named, and that CEO implements a preferred model. Ron Carucci and Jarrod Shappel in a 2020 Harvard Business Review article, �Organizing for the Future: Nine Keys to Becoming a Future Ready Company�, recommend a redesign approach that, among other things, advocates closing down structures that are no longer fit to purpose and being aware when culture becomes internally focused and constraining versus market focused and enabling. Again, the point is to be flexible and outward facing in creating new policies, processes and systems. Microsoft is one company that has done this well. When Satya Nadella took over Microsoft in 2014, he quickly determined that the company was not aligned or organized for the future. To remedy the situation, he started changing the culture to align with the new realities. For instance, he implemented a learning philosophy and programs, insisting that Microsoft would move from a know-it-all to a learn-it-all mindset.

Microsoft�s stock price has risen almost tenfold in the past ten years after being flat for the previous ten years. Sometimes, CEOs implement new policies and programs that catalyze a rethinking of structural elements. At Shopify, CEO Toby Lutke banished meetings from all employees� calendars. He asked people to decide whether they needed the meetings and if so, did they need them to be held for as much time as in the past and with as many invitees as was the norm. Or, conversely, could they do away with these meetings. It can be argued that meetings have long been the structural fuel on which organizations run, and to challenge whether that fuel is necessary is a major step toward the future. DOUBLING DOWN INSTEAD OF PLACING NEW BETS\r\r\tRedesigns can be messy. For this reason, people question whether they�re worth it. Can�t we get by with what we have if we make a few tweaks. Unfortunately, a few tweaks aren�t sufficient, given the major shifts in every sector of our society. AI is turbo-charging the multi-earner and gig economy, and this trend alone mandates a redesign. A 2023 updated Morgan Stanley study showed that the multi-job trend had picked up steam, facilitated by generative AI. Their conclusion was that AI allowed people to be more productive and increased their ability to handle two or more jobs. They forecast that people with multiple jobs would account for $400 billion in income by 2030. Combined with more people than ever before pursuing side gigs and passion projects, this trend indicates that organizations would be wise to implement policies that fit this new reality",

Many organizations, however, have failed to invest fully in these new work policies. Instead, a backlash against traditional structures has become evident:\r\r\t�Resentment about having to return to the office and resumption of employee monitoring. While many companies have adopted hybrid work schedules in some form, organizations are also displaying recidivist tendencies�reverting to pre-COVID practices. Traditionally, companies felt the need to monitor employees. Supervisors often walked around and checked to make sure people were doing their jobs and used sign-in and sign-out sheets or time clocks to ensure that people put in a full day�s work. Now some organizations are returning to this monitoring mentality using technology. According to a September 25, 2023 Wall Street Journal article, more companies than in the past are using monitoring badge swipes to assess in-office presence and creative negative sanctions for people who refuse to return to the office; TikTok is one of the badge swipe companies and they ask employees to explain their absences. The article also quotes Amazon�s CEO raising the possibility that people who aren�t in the office three days weekly may not have long careers with the company. Monitoring is an organizational policy that is particularly offensive to younger employees who find it paternalistic and demeaning. �Rising support for unions and increasing number of strikes.

REDESIGN CONCEPTUALLY AND PRACTICALLY\r\r\tTo create a redesign that is effective now and for years to come, we need to think about structure more broadly than is typical. Most people think of business structures from an organizational chart perspective.

For years, we�ve fooled ourselves into believing that the organizational chart represents how the organization works. That was okay in less complex, volatile times, but it�s no longer acceptable. Consider that organizational charts and maps indicate how leaders want the company to operate, but the reality is often quite different. For instance, the maps and charts document zones of control rather than zones of influence. A title represents a position that may be vested with authority but not necessarily the authority to determine how work is done. These charts also impose clarity where there often is none. Business is messy, and operations often shape-shift based on circumstance, ignoring the flow chart. The official organizational structures are also limited in scope, failing to account for all the external partners, freelancers and other outside partners that have become necessities. Consider the static nature of organizational design, driven by internal factors (i. e. areas of expertise) and client/customer categories. In an increasingly globalized world filled with new marketplaces and transformed by technology, this design must be more organic, adapting to external stimuli. For this reason, redesigning the structures must take the following factors into consideration:\r\r\t�Customer benefit. This may seem obvious, but company design often reflects internal requirements first and customers second. Given the increasing diversity and changing needs of customers, organizations should consider creating different designs for different customers. This might mean co-locating with a customer or integrating with customer suppliers. Design discussed as a singular object is a misnomer. Plural designs make a lot more sense. �Talent advantage",

Instead, the model should accommodate the full range of talent. �Change adaption. The previous two points allude to this one: Organizational design must be flexible, able to shift as changes occur. Competitors change. Laws change. Markets change. The design, therefore, must anticipate that these shifts will occur and be created in such a way that adapting a policy or revamping a process isn�t a big deal. This is an organic, evolving approach to design (versus an artificial, static one). To deliver on strategy, one needs to update the design continuously. �Permeability. Traditional designs are closed systems. Today, they need to be open. They must be capable of connecting and fusing with other companies in an increasingly connected, fast-moving world.

Legacy structures tend to be companies built around the profit flows and products of today and yesterday. Legacy assets still generate cash flow, have customer and brand value and contain talent. But they also motivate leaders to maintain the status quo; they hook organizations on profitable existing products and services, on structures and processes built in and for an era that is rapidly disappearing. Perhaps more destructively, they discourage disruption; preserving the legacy is the main priority. The transformation, therefore, is treating these assets as the roots of the company�as foundational pieces from which new life grows. They provide the basis for this new life to take wing and soar, to become organizational designs optimized for new customer segments or other future targets. Roots keep the business viable today; wings help it remain viable in the future. Successful companies learn to combine roots and wings. Parts of the company are designed for today and others for tomorrow, but talent flows between the two models and leaders orchestrate this flow. �From bosses/zones of control to leaders/zones of influence. Essentially, this means moving from a structure where people�s power is based on their seniority, the amount/type of business they control and how many people report to them to a more organic system. In the former, turf wars are common, and people are incentivized to accumulate and retain power. In an organic system, the incentives are different�people are motivated to have influence and respond to external realities. �From seeing people and labor as a cost that must be controlled to an asset that requires an investment.

Because of these new beliefs and assumptions, organizations must rethink how they design everything from compensation systems to decision-making processes. On the most basic level, it means they must design structures from the outside in rather than the inside out. In a fast-changing world, companies must create their processes and procedures based on marketplace realities (i. e. emerging competitors and changing talent mindsets) rather than relying on �the way things have always been done around here�.

By restructuring roles, talent takes the initiative while management guides and coaches. This trust extends to empowering teams to solve problems and capitalize on opportunities in ways that make sense for their markets (rather than everyone following the mandate from headquarters). Management�s restructured role involves setting parameters�they grant their people freedom within a framework. They know where the guardrails should be erected to prevent teams from getting in legal difficulties or taking unreasonable risks. While many organizations have taken steps in this direction, most are not there yet. To assess redesign progress, the following questions might help:\r\t�Is your organization biased toward yesterday or tomorrow. �Does your company possess agile systems and processes.

On top of that, a new business model or new products and services may cannibalize existing ones and reduce margins. Fears about market reaction, too, can create redesign hesitancy. Business leaders worry that the financial markets and investors may view restructuring as a sign of trouble and be concerned about the fiscal downside. Organizations are also concerned that if they change the company significantly, they may experience a talent flight/shortage. People join a company thinking it�s one thing, and if it becomes something else, they might leave�especially if the nature of their job changes.

As we�ve discussed, media companies have stuck stubbornly to their business models�and paid the price. Newspapers failed to embrace digital and magazines did not grasp multi-media. More recently, television networks sold their content to Netflix to make money, then reversed positions and created competitive streaming services, reducing profitability. Media company leaders were aware of the changes in their industries but either because of short term financial risk or their own lack of ability to re-invent moved slowly and feebly. Similarly, many established retailers such as JC Penney, Macy�s and even Nordstrom are shells of their former selves.

They feature a conductor who leads a hierarchical group of players who follow a score note by note. In a classical orchestra, individuality takes a back seat to the greater whole. In jazz, on the other hand, individuality is key, hierarchy is largely absent and improvisation is encouraged. We need to use the jazz construct to redesign classical structures. Because of the need for speed and agility in terms of products and services, the growing importance of accommodating a range of employee preferences and the decreasing importance of company size, jazz-like structures are crucial for success. Understandably, classically-trained leaders struggle to adapt their structures in this jazz-friendly environment. The good news is that many of the best jazz players were classically trained and some of the best classical music including Gershwin�s Rhapsody in Blue or Dvorak�s 9th Symphony (New World) are infused with jazz-like structures. To risk mixing metaphors, I�m not advocating throwing out the baby with the bathwater",

They just need to apply these traits in more improvisational, flexible structures. To help organizations assess whether they�re in the jazz or classical camps, here are some useful questions:\r\t�Is hierarchy holding the company back. Are bosses followed due to their zone of control and intimidating titles (conductors) or because they�re leading through a zone of influence (talented players). �Is the organization rethinking things by starting with a blank sheet of paper (a license to improvise). Or are they replicating operational standards that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. �Is sufficient time and budget being allocated to help people learn to self-manage and to help leaders learn how to be more agile and adaptable. In terms of scale, bigger is no longer better. Authors of Exponential Organizations 2. 0, Salim Ismail, Peter Diamandis and Michael Malone, propose an alternative to traditional scaling strategies, one that capitalizes on external resources for growth. Instead of relying on a massive internal structure�huge numbers of employees, major sunk costs in infrastructure, strategies where a lot of people are thrown against business challenges�the scale alternative builds an agile, free-flowing external system. The following represents these three authors� ideas, filtered through my interpretative lens. For instance, the staff-on-demand concept involving putting together teams of pre-qualified workers hired on an as-needed basis. These individuals could be self-employed, free-lance, procured from third parties such as Upwork or even full-time employees (re-aggregated around the jobs that need to be done and then reassigned post-jobs)",

A community/crowd strategy, too, can help companies scale effectively now and in the future. Communities are built around users, customers, alumni as well as vendors, suppliers and fans who are aligned with a company�s transformational purpose. They are granted special favors, given insider insights and a forward look on future offerings and rewarded with gifts and trust. They are pseudo employees, citizens of the company�s larger community. Peloton and Apple have leveraged community from key developers to super fans. Organizations can leverage crowds to grow a company and find community as TikTok did in entertainment, Kiva in finance and GoFundMe in fund raising. Other methods exist to scale using external means, including the use of AI, leveraging assets and engagement (gamification, incentive prizes, etc. that keep stakeholders involved and committed to a shared purpose). The point of all these scaling alternatives is that they foster growth�sometimes surprisingly rapid and profitable growth�in ways that rely on innovative external strategy and tactics. In the Jazz age, these flexible, market-driven approaches make far more sense than the bureaucratic, hierarchical structures of years past. Chapter 13�RECALCULATE FINANCIALS\r\r\tThis chapter title is a bit of an understatement. It�s not just that we have to tweak our budgets�spending less on office space, for instance. It�s not just that we must learn to use outside resources more cost effectively. And it�s not just that we have to make significant investments in emerging technologies to increase long-term profitability. We need to rethink the entire financial model on which most organizations operate.

The organizations that do well at both�that are able to be flexible and innovative in creating new and improved financial models�will be the winners. A BRIEF ARGUMENT FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE\r\r\tIn the previous chapter I advocated redesigning structures, a significant effort but one that is justified by a variety of events and trends. Recalculating financials is similarly justified. Some might argue that this is only relevant for companies with digital products and services or new organizations with radically different business models. I would argue that all businesses are impacted by technology because they rely on everything from cloud-based services to digital communications to compete; because they have to change their approach to talent in a world of distributed and unbundled work; and because they must deal with new mindsets about what where, how, why and when we work. All of these issues affect how organizations spend and make money, not to mention customer expectations of personalized, 24/7 service, reaching emerging markets using social media and many other new and evolving factors. How do you run a competitive, profitable business in this environment. Advertising is an area I know well, and ad agencies have needed to recalculate their financials in major ways. For instance, traditional advertising was measured in reach (how many people one reached) and frequency (how many times a week or during a campaign they saw messages) and cost per thousand (the cost of reaching a thousand people) and rough metrics of success�return-on-investment represented by an increase in sales divided by spending",

Because products and services can be customized and different segments of customers targeted differently, these metrics are measured by audience and segment. Many other issues affect how ad agencies are recalculating financials, but these new metrics demand that they come up with new financial models for their clients that measure the numbers in more relevant ways.

The ability to access real-time data and analytics means that organizations can pivot quickly. Instead of sticking with a strategy that isn�t working (or failing to double down on one that is), they can finance on the fly, adjusting their budgets as situations warrant.

Cybersecurity tools and experts are now a significant expenditure for many organizations, and though the short-term costs are significant, the long-term benefits (saving companies from the expenses associated with being hacked) are even more significant. Blockchain and cryptocurrency have already had a major impact in many industries; crowdfunding and alternative financing have helped many startups grow quickly and become competitors to major companies; and subscription-based business models have provided viable alternatives to more traditional methods. Beyond technology, the changes in how and where we work has had a huge impact on organizational finances. On the corporate balance sheet, full-time employees and their salaries and benefits have been reduced while payments for part-time workers have increased.

If you were to ask the average person what is the major assets of airlines, the most common answer would be �the planes�. In fact, the value of airlines is rooted in their frequent flyer programs. A March 15, 2021 Wall Street Journal article describes how frequent flyer miles provide huge amounts of business, especially the program at American Airlines. According to the article, �American disclosed that, in 2019, its AAdvantage program generated $5. 9 billion in cash inflows, with a 53% margin. This is more than Delta�s SkyMiles and United�s MileagePlus, even though American is the least profitable of the three when it comes to actually selling tickets. The loyalty program accounted for roughly half of its entire earnings. �\r\tSynergies between companies in different industries also represent money-making opportunities now and in the future.

While there�s a lot of controversy surrounding cryptocurrencies, they too are offering money-making possibilities to forward-thinking organizations. Cryptocurrencies are essentially tokens (except Bitcoin) that operate like frequent flyer miles. These tokens can offer customers four benefits: currency, governance rights, membership and status.

At Publicis, for instance, we had different agencies working for the same client, resulting at times in separate bills from these agencies, duplication of effort and turf wars. This complexity is only going to become worse at many companies, and leaders need to figure out ways to coordinate employee projects effectively. �Best combination of resources to manage costs: Companies need to combine all the resources that go into creating products to ensure lowest cost and continuous availability. �Integrated measurement and dashboards: Businesses can combine myriad sources of data into an accessible, useable (by management) dashboard. ��Goldilocks� strategy for products and services: A sufficiently large range of services and options to remain competitive but not so many that their complexity leads to increased cost and consumer confusion. The goal is to find the ideal mix. Integrating all these elements in the face of fragmentation isn�t easy.

In a world where how, where, when and with whom work is done is changing, businesses must measure their financial metrics differently to maintain their financial health.

Now compare this figure with the cost of replacing the employee with two fractionalized employees, each working half time. Conceivably, two fractionalized workers can cost more than one full-time employee since the former may need health care benefits and office space and add administration costs. But it�s also conceivable that this arrangement would be more cost-effective in the long run. If both employees are happier, more productive and stay with the company longer than the full-time person, then the organization will benefit. A fractionalized option may also make it easier to attract superior talent and the flexibility of two people doing one job may also reduce costs. Here�s another scenario. A company decides to reduce its capital and IT costs by outsourcing its IT and replacing its on-location data centers with a 100 percent cloud solution. This outsourced solution reduces the cost of scale benefits, decreases capital expenditure and offers the flexibility to increase or decrease usage. On the other hand, cloud providers have been increasing costs, and companies can become locked in to ever-rising cloud fees. In addition, Large Language Models might be learning on a company�s data in the cloud without proper safeguards; this all-cloud decision can also hurt a company�s ability to differentiate. These are only two scenarios of many that have emerged relatively recently. They require financial recalculations to identify the best option.

Over time, though they became assets that they could offer to other companies. Today Amazon Web Services drives a significant portion of Amazon�s profit, and its logistics and shipment services have helped build its merchant business where thousands of businesses leverage the Amazon platform.

Here are a few basic steps that should help every business get started in the right way:\r\t�Recognize and incorporate multiple variables (rather than a few traditional ones) when it comes to talent. As labor gains more power as a consequence of supply and demand laws, companies must learn to value employees with a range of factors in mind.

Can the company correlate employee turnover with reduced revenue. What is the optimum mix of employees and work situations (fractionalized, remote, etc. ) for the greatest return on people assets. Some companies may assess these and other variables and determine that full-time employees who are paid above market are necessary; that these higher-paid people are essential to keep talent close to customers, to ensure high job and customer satisfaction levels and maintain reliability of delivery. Other companies, however, may decide that this traditional model is ineffective, that it fails to deal with the revenue ebbs and flows or doesn�t attract talent for whom location and flexibility are crucial. �Factor in the intangibles. This means considering previously ignored or subordinated issues such as employee joy (positive employee net promoter scores); and the need and costs of retraining bosses for a world of diverse backgrounds and mindsets.

In fact, AI will have a far greater impact than even many of its most ardent fans claim, especially in the world of work. Consider a few facts. First, as of this writing, Chat GPT (which introduced many people to AI) is only one year old. Second, in less than one year, Open AI, Anthropic, Google and others have significantly enhanced the capabilities of their products and services by many factors while significantly reducing costs. Third, AI is doing so many tasks that were done by young law associates. According to a Goldman Sachs report, AI is capable of performing 44% of legal tasks. Fourth, a new television program called Channel One uses AI Avatars built on human scans and other technologies to create an AI generated news program",

Shakespeare wrote that �past is prologue�, and that is especially true here. The computational age drove the cost of computation to zero while the Internet drove the cost of distribution to zero. AI is likely to drive the cost of knowledge to zero. Since every job requires a specific type of knowledge, all jobs will be affected, but especially those in knowledge industries like marketing, finance, law and so on. Therefore, here are some predictions:\r\t�People whose main job is collecting, distilling or distributing knowledge/information will find that AI is doing most if not all of their job. AI is far more efficient and far faster than people, so this one is a no-brainer. �� Use it or lose it� will determine organizational and personal survival. Companies and individuals who resist AI will be replaced by companies and individuals who do. This is very Darwinian�survival of the fittest. AI is a superpower, and whoever embraces it will have a huge competitive edge. Think about what happened to people and industries that didn�t embrace electricity�or automobiles�or computing. �Companies and society will be reorganized around AI. It�s similar to the advent of the assembly line or the building of highways or the proliferation of suburban living. The difference is that AI�s effects will happen faster than those of the paradigm-shifting events just described. AI will impact everything in hugely significant ways, from search engines to medicine. �Political and societal turbulence will shake everyone�s world. As this technology advances, it will lead to major disruptions. Expect a lot of op eds for and against AI. Certainly, there will be arguments similar to the �automation� discussions of years ago about how machines take away jobs from people",

Instead of falling prey to the paranoid arguments about rogue AI ending the world, leaders must communicate how it will empower individuals, catalyze new businesses and provide incredible opportunities for small businesses. No question, the transition to an AI world will be chaotic. But as long as leaders pursue a 3E strategy of embedding, enhancing and extending their existing products and service with AI, the transition will be a positive one. Organizations should take a cue from companies like Microsoft using Co-pilot and Google using Bard, how they�ve scaled and made available this technology to many millions of users in a matter of weeks. If business leaders follow their lead, they will greet AI with continuous learning and open imaginations, and the results will be transformative. THE RISE AND FALL OF GIANTS\r\tWhen companies like AT&T, IBM, General Electric and General Motors were the world�s leading organizations in the 20th century, it seemed as if they might always occupy their lofty positions. Few could envision the emergence of new, dominant companies and industries. Apple, Google, Amazon and others rose with astonishing speed to become leaders in their categories. Will the same scenario take place in the years ahead. As tempting as it might be to predict that we�ll have a similar changing of the guard in the future, the following graphic provides a needed corrective to this thinking, showing the most valuable companies over the last three decades (Source: GPT-4):  \r\r      The lists are surprisingly similar, with four types of companies dominating the list (technology, pharmaceuticals, energy, and financial powerhouses) and Walmart. This is a decade, two decades and three decades after the birth of the Internet",

Some new technology companies like Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor make the list today, replacing a Nokia, IBM, and Intel. Why. Because Nokia failed to re-imagine phones and let Apple thrive; Intel failed to re-imagine chips, allowing Nvidia take the lead; and IBM couldn�t grasp the next generation of many things including silicon manufacturing, giving Taiwan Semiconductor an opening to dominate. Similarly, Citi has been eclipsed by JP Morgan. But overall, the top lists are remarkably similar by type of company with really only one new entrant, Meta, built on the relatively new social media category. Given this historical performance, the list of leading companies a decade from now shouldn�t be that much different from the 2023 list. It�s likely that Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Exxon, JP Morgan, Procter and Gamble and Walmart will remain in the top 25. They and other major corporations have been taught the need to adapt and incorporate the latest technologies and ways of working learning�the cautionary tales of Nokia and GE have not been lost on them. At the same time, we�re bound to see the rise of certain companies in certain industries:\rAI: While Alphabet and Microsoft are well on the way to become giants of an AI age, they are likely to be joined by new players such as Byte Dance, the parent of Tik Tok. Biotechnology: In addition to AI, it is likely that a new giant focused on biotech like a Moderna will emerge. Climate Technology: As concern about climate grows, so too will the companies in the category�at least one is bound to emerge from the pack, especially if they�re able to address major concerns in a way that is innovate and effective. While the mix of leading corporations may not change dramatically, they will operate differently from the way they did in the past for reasons we�ve discussed",

And they will be run with a greater focus on employee joy�as I�ve emphasized, talent and culture will become the key differentiator as other areas become commoditized. Perhaps the biggest change in the eco-system of companies will be the proliferation of smaller companies connected directly and indirectly to the giants. As members of younger generations want to work independently or pursue side hustles and as technology makes this increasingly feasible, the giant corporations will become reliant on millions more small businesses and independent contractors. It will be the whale-and-plankton paradigm. The debate between big and small is a false debate because the future model will need big and small working together. There will continue to need to be the need for what I call �old scale� which is the scale of resources, scale of size, scale of spending and scale of manufacturing in almost all industries. To create break throughs in computing, bio-technology, transportation or many other fields one will require the investments to capital, huge pools of data and the ability to invest in R&D over years as the large pharma companies such as Merck or Pfizer, technology companies like Google and Microsoft and transportation companies such as GM and Toyota do.

A BETTER CORPORATE CLIMATE\r\r\tOne of the silver linings of the COVID period was the effect it had on pollution. By reducing the number of commuter cars as people worked from home, COVID had the unintentional consequence of also reducing carbon emissions. A study reported in the National Academy of Sciences journal found that when people work from home two days per week, they help decrease pollution by around 15%. Another study reported in that journal noted that remote workers could reduce the carbon footprint by 54% compared to office employees. Most organizations are already emphasizing sustainability, and this emphasis will increase and broaden in the coming years. Increasing the number of remote working hours and decreasing in-office requirements certainly will be part of this sustainability effort. Companies are bound to implement other practices to decrease their carbon footprint. For instance, to mitigate the urban heat island effect, offices might incorporate more green spaces, both inside and outside",

The use of energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, smart thermostats, and water-saving devices will become standard in offices to reduce environmental impact. Companies with employees in certain states will be especially focused on climate change policies. Because of increases in temperature, wildfires, hurricanes and insurance costs, they will have a vested interest in trying solve these problems; if they don�t, their people will be understandably aggrieved. Insurance costs alone have increased by almost 50% between 2021 and 2023 in the five states where these climate change effects are most pronounced. But if we look into the future to assess the impact of climate change, what really stands out are two major shifts. First, we�re likely to see job sector shifts. Traditional industries like fossil fuels may decline, while renewable energy sectors like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are likely to expand, creating new jobs. A corresponding increase in \"green jobs\" will occur, focused on environmental protection, sustainability, and climate change mitigation. This includes roles in environmental science, conservation, and sustainable business practices. As a result of this shift, we�re going to see an increased demand for education and training programs related to sustainability, renewable energy and climate science. The other climate change-catalyzed shift relates to a topic we�ve discussed in a different context: increased automation. As some outdoor jobs become unsafe due to heat, flooding or other issues, automation offers an alternative to get jobs done without endangering people�s lives",

WHAT WILL MAKE FUTURE COMPANIES GREAT. It�s not what made companies great in the past. Building a better mousetrap is no longer a pathway to long-term success, since these mousetraps can be knocked off quickly. Excellent strategies, too, are terrific at launching products and services, but they aren�t sustainable�pivoting from one strategy to the next is crucial in a volatile world. Hiring the best and the brightest is obviously an excellent idea, but how you keep the best and the brightest in place has become more important than ever before. For these reasons, here are three viable approaches to future greatness and the companies that are early adopters:\r\r\t�Treat talent with respect by trusting them and offering them significant flexibility. This is what younger generations demand, and it will require organizations to make a leap of faith to offer this trust and flexibility. Future leaders should follow the example of Dropbox, a self-titled �virtual-first� company where employees spend 90% of their time working remotely. Despite their embrace of remote work, Dropbox does no monitoring of employees. Dropbox CEO Drew Houston is quoted in Fortune magazine as saying, �If you trust people add treat them like adults, they�ll behave like adults. �  In Business Insider, it�s reported that �70% of hired employees cite Virtual First as the main reason they applied for a role at Dropbox. � \r\tAirbnb has embraced the concept of flexibility, embodied by their �live and work anywhere� policy. It�s not just that they can work from home but from anywhere in the world, and Airbnb�s executives work with governments in 170 countries to facilitate this relocation (for up to 90 days per year per company)",

John Deere and Starbucks provide good models for companies to follow in the coming years. Deere, the agricultural equipment manufacturer, is creating technology-based services to increase farmers� profitability, essentially building a new business model around its tech. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, Starbucks uses AI to time orders so that they meet customer needs�rather than first come, first served, AI synchronizes the process to the point that customers receive their coffee at the optimum temperatures. Again, every company recognizes the value of AI and technology, but the winners in the future will not only recognize it but be willing to create new business models and processes that maximize the value of its products and services for customers. �Integrate sustainable social, environmental and cultural practices into all aspects of the business to build reputation. This means doing everything possible to save the planet, contribute to a more equitable society and be empathetic toward employees� wants and needs. Perhaps the best exemplar of these qualities is tech company Siemens. They have made a commitment to improving in the aforementioned areas, and they measure their progress in each. For instance, they�ve reduced their carbon emissions by 50% from 2019 to 2023. They�ve increased the number of women in leadership positions from 23% in 2020 to 31% in 2023. They�ve received a lot of positive recognition for these efforts, including being named as one of the top ten companies in Fast Company�s ranking of the 2023�s 100 Best Companies for Innovators.

Customers are going to decide who to do business with based on success in these spheres. A LEADERSHIP EVOLUTION\r\r\tI�ve discussed the need for a new type of leadership in our increasingly distributed world of work; how we require CEOs and other senior executives who can help the generational groups overcome their differences and work together productively; and how we need leaders who grasp the implications of new technologies and are adept at integrating them into the corporate DNA. In ten years or so, we�re going to see even more technological advances, Millennials will be running many businesses and the idea of an office where people gather to work may be viewed as an anachronism. Though it�s impossible to predict some of the changes that will occur (no doubt, there�s another Steve Jobs or Elon Musk out there creating something that will change everything), I can guarantee that the work environment will be even more complex, volatile and challenging than it is today. With that in mind, let me leave you with four suggestions for leaders to help companies thrive in this environment:\r\r\t�Prioritize inspiration. AI and many other technologies that are yet to be invented will take over many jobs that have always been done by people. As a result, the need to manage workers will become far less important than in the past. Yet what no technology that I know about can do is inspire people to work more creatively and more productively. People are emotional beings, and as such, they can�t be treated like cogs in a machine (or algorithms in a machine). We need leaders who can guide and mentor people with different mindsets and from different generations, who can help them align, collaborate and create. �Foster continuous learning. The need to learn in response to change will increase exponentially",

    "input": "Train on this high-priority content from Rishad's current thinking: I know I�ve talked about this before, but I can�t overemphasize this leadership imperative. Encouraging people to adopt a growth mindset will be key. If leaders do not allocate several hours weekly to learn and practice the new technologies and do not expose themselves to opposing or different generational points of view, they will be in trouble. Turning entire businesses into continuous learning organizations will be necessary. Leaders are the only ones who can allocate sufficient funds for this objective and prevent budget cuts from undermining it. If they have to make cuts, then cut real estate or staff or marketing, but if they reduce their learning investment, they will become obsolete because their people will become obsolete. �Connect the dots. This is something technology can�t do and probably won�t be able to do in the future. By connect the dots, I�m referring to cross-pollinating different people and their ideas�different functional expertise, different offices, different countries. Synergies happen when people are connected in new and dynamic ways. Cross-training, too, is crucial, so people possess knowledge beyond their narrow areas of expertise and can engage in synergistic thinking. �Communicate clearly, eloquently and motivationally. Some leaders today are compared to machines�they are extremely efficient, but they�re also dull and unemotional. In a machine age, we need leaders who develop their original voices and authentic points of view. Going back to the first point in this section, you can�t inspire people if you�re machine-like. Leaders who develop their ability to communicate powerfully in writing and in person�who can write and speak emotionally as well as cognitively�will provide a necessary counterbalance to a world awash in numbers and code. I have great faith in our ability to develop leaders who embody all these traits. Throughout history, business leaders have reinvented themselves to be aligned with their eras",
