In Colombo, Sri Lanka, lies a cemetery containing the grave of Arthur Charles Clarke who wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey.The gravestone has this phrase inscribed on it:"He never grew up, but he never stopped growing"Arthur C Clarke remained forever young.By ensuring a growth mindset our companies and ourselves can also attempt to remain forever young.Our mobile operating system has upgraded itself 18 times in the past 18 years (Apple) or 16 times (Android)All around us software is constantly updating itself.How many times have we upgraded our mental operating system in the past 18 years?Rethought our internal architecture and our API's on how we connect and perceive and adapt?After all keeping our bodies in shape is not the same as ensuring our minds are constantly upgrading themselves.By upgrading our mental operating systems we can remain forever young long after our bodies stop being so.The lyrics of Forever Young are by Bob Dylan but the best renditions of this song have tended to be by Joan Baez.Today some of the very powerful and wealthy might benefit from finding ways to rekindle the younger person in them that their older selves may be suppressing. To remember when idealism, youthful courage and the vivacity of the new idea enabled the possibilities of anything.Forever Young by Bob Dylan.May God bless and keep you alwaysMay your wishes all come trueMay you always do for othersAnd let others do for youMay you build a ladder to the starsAnd climb on every rungMay you stay forever youngMay you stay forever youngMay you grow up to be righteousMay you grow up to be trueMay you always know the truthAnd see the light surrounding youMay you always be courageousStand upright and be strongMay you stay forever youngMay you stay forever youngMay your hands always be busyMay your feet always be swiftMay you have a strong foundationWhen the winds of changes shiftMay your heart always be joyfulMay your song always be sungAnd may you stay forever youngMay you stay forever youngBut in many ways we do not remain forever young.Our bodies give way, our minds lose a step, raw intelligence is replaced by crystalized intelligence and wisdom.There comes a time to let go, to move on, to climb a second mountain, to pass the baton to a newer generation.From the main stage to an encore career or a new life.A different type of growing.To find a fit where one's current state of youth is aligned with reality.Every career and role has a midnight hour and the smart people leave at five to twelve.When still seen as a prince or princess and not yet a pumpkin.There are limits to forever young.And understanding that one can remain forever young, constantly upgrading and having a growth mindset but understanding that is not the same as youth is what the truly forever young understand.By not overstaying in a role, a point of view, a belief as the world changes is the we we stay...Forever Young.This week two ways of keeping memories and spaces every young:On What Next?
