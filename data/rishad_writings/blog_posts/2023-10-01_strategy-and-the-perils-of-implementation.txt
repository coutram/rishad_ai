What will people need and expect? How will demographics, technology and other global shifts create new competitors or recharge current competitors and how will categories blur, blend and maybe even disappear?Amidst these new expectations and changing competitive dynamics what advantage will your company offer? A differentiated or better product? A competitive moat of network effects, scale or some other dynamic? A better experience? Speed and value?While Strategy firms can be amazingly helpful in guiding companies through these questions, most leaders already have a gut instinct on what needs to be done. The deep dive documents, the chanting strategists and the long march of meetings are to bring others along and to provide an intellectual and analytical framework for a decision that clearly had to be made.If you work for a firm and you have an idea of where the future is going and how changing people’s expectations and emerging technology are going to create challenges or opportunities, you should go to your management and share your thinking.All you need to talk about is future competitive advantage.Why strategies often fail in implementationCompanies often allocate large swaths of senior management time and budgets for outside specialists to help them sculpt and then move the strategy forward.A cavalcade of consultants convey and communicate with countless charts and creative conjuring to the C-Suite.A flurry of futurists frame, focus, and filter the way forward with the finesse of fortune tellers.Masters of the Universe market M&A moves that might make multiples move upwards and mean many more millions in market-cap.PR professionals produce and promote points of view that provoke the press to perceive with pristine perspectives.These efforts when successful result in the first three key steps to strategy implementation1) A simple and differentiated strategic blueprint.2) An M&A plan to acquire skills, markets and technology.3) A re-organization since the future does not fit in the containers of the past.These are essential ingredients to a recipe of change and growth none of these will work without helping grow and change the people in the organization.Because while firms are a collection of ideas, technologies, patents, brands, ecosystems and people, it is people who are the key since they create the ideas, technologies, patents, brands and eco-systems!Michael Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face”.Boards and leadership of firms come quickly to the realization that everything is easy until people get in the way.Telling people that change is good, threatening them with job loss if they do not change or creating communication materials and slogans to goad them into a cult like devotion to the new dear leader or the way forward rarely works in the short run and will likely fail after the threat of flagellation fades.Because if there is nothing in it for them, people will out-wit, out-wait, out-pretend, and out-maneuver “management”. Until then they will fill the time genuflecting and bowing and going through the monitored motions of attending the right meetings, muttering the motivational mantras and stating the slogans required.The keys to implementing strategy.If a strategy is to be leveraged in ways that transform an organization, it is key to remember that the only true transformation happens is when the mindsets, skillsets and behaviors of the people working for the firm transform.If you want your organization or team to grow and change you will need to ask your team to initiate a) a three-question exercise while leadership b) delivers three clear answers to employees.The Three Question Exercise every team should consider doing so they can both understand, get aligned with and contribute to strategy.1) How do we expect peoples as well as our customers/consumers/members needs and expectations to change in the future?2) What are our key strengths and weaknesses in meeting and aligning with these shifts?3) I3) If we had no constraints except that we had to ensure that what we did was legal, that it was technologically possible and financially broke even in 3 years or less what products and services would we design? Alternatively if we gamed ourselves as a new entrant in attack mode how would we take market share away from ourselves on a particular product or customer segment?This exercise makes people look up from their day to day and understand risks and opportunities and helps them realize the need for doing things differently. As importantly it gets them to contribute and activate the strategy in their areas of competence and expertise. It also allows leaders to go into attack mode versus thinking only defensively.The Three Clear Answers management needs to deliver to company staff in order for them to align with and implement the strategy:1) Why are the recommended changes good for their personal career growth?2) What are the monetary or other incentives to change?3) When and where will training be provided to help them learn the new skills needed?Change does not happen because of M&A, press releases, re-organizations or a new leader, all of which undoubtedly play a role.An organization changes and grows when the people in the organization change and grow.Images using Mid-JourneyShareSubscribeRishad is an author, speaker, teacher and advisor who helps people think, feel and see differently about how to grow their companies, their teams and themselves.
